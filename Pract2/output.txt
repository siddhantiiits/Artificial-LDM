he case concerns the applicant™s alleged inability to have recourse to judicial review of the decision to transfer him to a different and lower ranking judicial district..THE APPLICANT™S CAREER AS A JUDGE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO HIS TRANSFER1.  The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Ankara. He was represented by Mr M.  a lawyer practising in Ankara.2.  The Government were represented by their Agent.3.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.4.  On 27 February 1979 the applicant was appointed as an apprentice rapporteur judge at the Supreme Administrative Court, after having successfully completed written and oral examinations.5.  Between 28 February 1980 and 28 February 1981 the applicant worked as a deputy clerk for the Supreme Administrative Court. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT26.  On 28 February 1981 the applicant took up his duties as a rapporteur judge at the Supreme Administrative Court.7.  Between 1 August 1981 and 30 November 1982 the applicant took leave to complete his military service at the Ministry of Defence as a legal clerk.8.  In February 1983 the applicant was appointed as a judge at the Gaziantep Administrative Court, a court in the second judicial district, where he became the presiding judge in August 1987.9.  In December 1990 the applicant was reappointed to the position of rapporteur judge at the Supreme Administrative Court. For the purposes of that post, he was considered to have served in the third judicial district. After working in that position for a year and three months, he resigned. On 27 September 1993 he returned to the profession and was appointed as a judge in the Sakarya Administrative Court, a court in the second judicial district, where he held judicial office until October 1995. During the course of his term in the Sakarya Administrative Court, he advanced to the first grade.10.  In October 1995 the applicant was assigned to the Ankara Administrative Court and in July 1998 he was promoted to the position of presiding judge in the Eighth Division of the Ankara Administrative Court, a court in the first judicial district. After holding judicial office there for seven years, on 9 July 2005 he was assigned as a judge to the Ankara Regional Administrative Court by a decree of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (hereinafter ﬁthe HSYKﬂ). He applied for a review of that decision, but his application was rejected by the same body on 15 September 2005.11.  The applicant filed an objection against the decision of 15 September 2005 before the Objections Board (  Kurulu), which rejected the objection on 14 November 2005.12.  By a decree of the HSYK of 15 July 2006, the applicant was assigned to the Sivas Regional Administrative Court, a judicial administrative district of the third category, which was lower in rank than the districts where he had previously held office. No grounds were cited for the nature of the transfers contained in the decree.13.  On 27 July 2006 the applicant applied for a review of the decision of 15 July 2006, arguing that he had been assigned twice to different locations in the previous two years without any justification being given and against his will. He further argued that his assignments did not comply with the guarantees of judicial independence. Moreover, his latter assignment to a lower judicial district had had a negative effect on his professional reputation, especially since the reasons for the assignment had not been disclosed, creating the impression that he had been implicitly punished. He further argued that the decision to assign him to Sivas, a city which was 440 km away from Ankara where his family resided, interfered with his right to  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT3respect for family life. He explained in that connection that neither his daughters, who were attending educational institutions in Ankara, nor his wife, who worked for a private company in Ankara, had been able to relocate with him to Sivas.14.  On 19 September 2006 the applicant was informed by the Ministry of Justice that the HSYK had dismissed his application for a review on the grounds that his assignment had been justified on the basis of the needs of the public service. No further reasons were disclosed.15.  The applicant did not file an objection against that decision.16.  On 20 September 2007 the applicant applied for early retirement. According to his official service record, he had served twenty-three years eleven months and twenty-eight days and, taking into account the year of military service, he was found to qualify for a pension on the basis of twenty-four years eleven months and twenty-eight days of service.II.APPRAISAL OF APPLICANT™S PERFORMANCE DURING HIS PRESIDENCY OF THE ANKARA ADMINISTRATIVE COURT17.  In their observations, the Government submitted an appraisal of the applicant of 31 May 2005, in which he had been assessed by four justice inspectors. The Government contended that the appraisal in question had played a role in the HSYK™s decision to transfer the applicant. The appraisal form contained ten sections in which the applicant was awarded points out of ten. He was appraised on his administration of the case files and backlog; his diligence in rendering injunction measures and in his other responsibilities in the capacity of a single judge; his ability to render sensitive interim decisions and his timely performance of on-site examinations; his knowledge of the rules of procedure and their application to cases; his ability to render decisions in a timely and correct manner; the sufficiency of the reasoning given in decisions; his ability to conduct hearings; his research skills and ability to keep up with legislative and other changes in the field of law; his relationship with the Registry of the court and its library; and his diligence in taking necessary measures for the conduct of proceedings and the work of the court. His overall professional score was 65 and the inspectors inserted the following comment:ﬁIt would be appropriate to remove him from the post of president and relocate him to a court other than Ankara.ﬂ18.  In reply to the Government™s submissions concerning his appraisal, the applicant submitted the following information and documents. On an unspecified date he submitted a request to the HSYK concerning the incremental raise he should have received on account of his grade (see paragraph 26 below). On 10 October 2006 the HSYK dismissed the applicant™s request, stating that he was no longer eligible to stand for election to the position of Supreme Administrative Court judge on account  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT4of his appraisal report of 2005. He applied for a review and filed an objection, which were rejected by the HSYK on 22 May 2007 and 11 September 2007 respectively.19.  In the meantime, that is on 10 May 2007, the applicant applied, on the basis of the Right to Information Act, to the Ministry of Justice requesting disclosure of the reasons for receiving a score of ﬁaverageﬂ in his appraisal of 2005. He further requested all his appraisal records for the years 1997 to 2005.20.  In its reply of 23 May 2007, the Ministry informed the applicant that he had received an appraisal score of ﬁgoodﬂ (iyi) for the years 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2003, and ﬁaverageﬂ (orta) for 2005. As regards disclosure of the reasons, the Ministry stated that the appraisal forms constituted classified information as part of the applicant™s personal administrative file and that it had been decided by the Minister of Justice to keep appraisal records outside the scope of the Right to Information Act, since they were only recommendations and did not result in or directly affect the concerned person™s rights.21.  On 31 May 2007 the applicant submitted the same request to the Justice Inspection Board. In its reply of 11 June 2007, reiterating the response of the Ministry, the Board further stated that the result of the applicant™s appraisal of 2005 had been notified to him on 4 July 2005, along with a list of recommendations for improvement, and pointed out that he had not objected to those recommendations.III.DOMESTIC LEGAL FRAMEWORKA.Provisions of the Constitution22.

Following a national referendum held on 12 September 2010, a number of amendments were made to the Constitution including Article 159 whereby decisions of the HSYK concerning dismissal from the judicial profession became amenable to judicial review. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT6B.Judges and Prosecutors Act (Law no. 2802)24.  The relevant provisions of Law no. 2802, as in force at the time, provided as follows:Section 15 Œ Grades and seniorityﬁThere shall be four grades for judges and prosecutors: third grade, second grade, reserved-for-first grade, and first grade.Those who successfully complete three years in the reserved-for-first grade category, and provided that they have not lost their credentials to advance to first grade, shall advance to first grade....ﬂSection 32 Œ Conditions for the reserved-for-first gradeﬁIn order to advance to the reserved-for-first grade, the following conditions must be fulfilled:a) to have advanced to the first [highest] step,b) to have completed at least ten years of service in the post of a judge or a prosecutor,c) to have a proven track record in professional and scientific knowledge,d) not to have received the sanction of disciplinary transfer,e) not to have received more than once the sanction of reprimand, deferment of advancement to a higher grade or deferment of promotion,f) not to have been convicted of an offence related to the duties of the office or any other offence that is incompatible with the dignity and reputation of the profession....ﬂSection 35 Œ Appointment by way of transferﬁJudges and prosecutors are appointed to judicial office in a court of the same level at an equal or higher position [whether] in the same or a different location without prejudice to their salary scale and seniority status.In the classification of judicial districts, geographical location, economic conditions, opportunities for social and cultural activities and health facilities, the transport system and similar factors are taken into account. The term of office to be served in each judicial district shall be determined by regulation.In the judicial administrative network, the regional administrative court ranks higher with respect to place of service than the administrative and tax courts in the same judicial district....Provided that it is documented, failure in the exercise of professional duties may result in a transfer to a different judicial district regardless of term of office or seniority.Personal, family-related or other reasons that are set out in appointment and transfer regulations may be taken into account in a request for transfer.ﬂ v. TURKEY JUDGMENT7Section 46 Œ Special situations of transferﬁ...Where an investigation or a document reveals that a judge or a prosecutor, through no fault of his own, is incapable of exercising his duties with the independence and dignity required for holding judicial office, he will be relocated in the same judicial district.Where an investigation or a document reveals that a judge or a prosecutor has not performed his duties with the requisite expeditiousness and quality, he will be relocated to any other office or place, without taking into account his seniority and term of office in a judicial district.ﬂSection 62 Œ Disciplinary sanctionsﬁThe High Council of Judges and Prosecutors shall impose one of the following sanctions on judges and prosecutors for conduct that is incompatible with their duties and with the dignity of the office:a) a warning,b) a reduction in salary,c) a reprimand,d) deferment of advancement to a higher rank,e) deferment of promotion,f) transfer,g) dismissal from profession....ﬂSection 68 Œ Sanction of disciplinary transferﬁDisciplinary transfer is a transfer to a judicial district that is at least one degree lower for the period of service that is mandatory for that district.The following are sanctioned with disciplinary transfer:a) culpable or inappropriate conduct incompatible with the honour and dignity of judicial office or [leading to] loss of personal dignity and honour,b) personal or professional conduct which may be perceived such that judicial independence and competence are undermined,c) conduct which, in the carrying out of duties, gives the impression that personal relationships or convictions are prioritised,d) culpable behaviour in relationships with colleagues that impairs the exercise of duties,e) conduct that creates a perception that bribes are accepted or corrupt practices engaged in, even though there might be no evidence,f) requests for or acceptance of gifts or loans, directly or through an intermediary, for personal gain or advantage.ﬂSection 58 Œ Personal administrative files v.

Sections 99 to 101 of Law no. 2802, under the heading of ﬁinspectionﬂ, provide for a Justice Inspection Board composed of the Minister of Justice, a chairperson who is appointed to that post by a joint decision of the Minister, Prime Minister and the President from among judges or prosecutors of the first grade, a vice-chair and justice inspectors. Justice inspectors are appointed from among judges and prosecutors who have completed at least five years of service. They are empowered to assess the way in which judges and prosecutors carry out their duties, to investigate offences in relation to the office they hold, and to assess whether their conduct and behaviour is compatible with the office they hold. Justice inspectors can hear persons under oath. They have search powers and the authority to collect all evidence or other information directly from official bodies.26.  Under section 103 of the same law, judges and prosecutors of the first grade receive an incremental raise of two percent on their gross salary every three years, so long as they retain the credentials to be elected to the Court of Cassation or the Supreme Administrative Court. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT9C.High Council of Judges and Prosecutors Act (Law no. 2461)27.  The HSYK (renamed the Council of Judges and Prosecutors (ﬁHSKﬂ) in 2017) is the central body responsible for organisation of the judiciary, with power to decide on the appointment, transfer, promotion and removal of judges and prosecutors, and to impose disciplinary sanctions against them. It also takes the final decision on proposals from the Ministry of Justice concerning the abolition of a court, or changes in a court™s territorial jurisdiction.At the time of the events giving rise to the application, the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors Act (Law no. 2461) was in force. Accordingly, the HSYK was composed of the following members: (i) the Minister of Justice, who acted as its president; (ii) the Under-secretary of State for Justice; (iii) three regular and three substitute members from the Court of Cassation; and (iv) two regular and two substitute members from the Supreme Administrative Court. Regular and substitute members of the judiciary were selected for membership of the HSYK by the State President from among three candidates nominated by the respective plenaries of the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court. The term of office of HSYK members was four years, and members could be re-elected.28.  A quorum of the HSYK was constituted when all members were present. Decisions were taken by a majority vote, abstention counting as a negative vote. The HSYK™s meetings took place at the premises of the Ministry of Justice, which also carried out its administrative tasks (section 10). The law provided for the independence of the HSYK (section 3) and contained provisions for the withdrawal of its members when grounds for recusal so warranted (sections 14 and 15). Section 13 provided that in rendering decisions on the imposition of disciplinary sanctions and the examination of objections to its decisions, the HSYK and the Objections Board should decide, according to their conscience, by freely considering all the evidence for and against the defendant and with a view to public interest and the honour and dignity of the profession of a judge. The HSYK was also empowered to decide on its procedures and working methods in carrying out its responsibilities by means of internal regulations. The internal regulations which were applicable at the time of the present dispute, published on 14 July 1981 in the Official Gazette, did not contain any particular rules or guidelines with respect to the procedure to be observed in proceedings before the HSYK, other than those specified above.29.  Section 11 provided that the Minister of Justice or interested parties could request the HSYK to review a decision within ten days of its notification. Section 12 provided that interested parties could object to a decision taken by the HSYK on review within ten days of the date on which the decision was served on them before the Objections Board. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT10The Objections Board, presided over by the Minister of Justice and composed of regular and substitute members of the HSYK, examined the objection. A minimum of eight members had to be present to examine the objection. The decision of the Objections Board was final. No appeal could be lodged against that final decision with an administrative or judicial authority.D.Regulations on the Appointment of Judges and Prosecutors to the Administrative Courts, published in the Official Gazette on 19 February 198830.  The relevant provisions of the Regulations on the Appointment of Judges and Prosecutors (ﬁRegulations on Appointmentﬂ), as in force at the time of the events, provided in so far as relevant as follows:Section 2 Œ Judicial districtsﬁThere are three administrative judicial districts, as set out in the appendix, created in view of geographical location and economic conditions, opportunities for social and cultural activities, health facilities, transport systems and similar factors....ﬂSection 3 - Term of office in a judicial districtﬁSave for the exceptions provided for in these regulations, the term of office to be served in the judicial administrative districts shall be as follows: five years in the third judicial district, seven years in the second district and ten years in the first district.ﬂSection 4 Œ Rules of appointmentﬁSave for selection by lot from a list of candidates and appointments made for necessary reasons, appointments to courts are made starting with the lower district.Save for the exceptions set out in these regulations, judges who have not served the mandatory term of office in the relevant judicial district may not request to be appointed or be appointed ex officio. At their request, judges who have served two years in any one of the judicial districts may be appointed to a judicial district equal to or lower than the one in which they currently serve or may be appointed ex officio to a higher rank in the same judicial district.Provided that it is documented, a judge who has performed poorly and whose conduct has been incompatible with the requirements of the office may be assigned to an appropriate judicial district, irrespective of seniority or the term he or she has served in a judicial district.Appointments depend on the availability of posts and the competence and abilities of the candidates. Candidates™ preferences may be taken into account in so far as possible.ﬂSection 5 Œ Appointment to the first judicial districtﬁSave for the exceptions set out in these regulations, only judges reserved for the first grade can be appointed to a court in the first judicial district. Remaining in that district shall depend on performance and conduct. Those who have served the minimum term in the first judicial district may be reassigned.ﬂ v. TURKEY JUDGMENT11Section 7 Œ Special situations of transferﬁa) Where it is understood that judges and prosecutors, without being culpable, may not be carrying out their duties in accordance with the honour and impartiality required of the office, they shall be assigned to another office in the same judicial district.b) Where it transpires from an investigation or documents that a judge or prosecutor cannot keep up with the work or show the required competence, they shall be assigned to another office in the same or lower judicial district, irrespective of their grade or seniority.c) In the case of a disciplinary transfer, the judge or prosecutor in question shall immediately be assigned to an office in a lower judicial district. If no office is available in the lower district, they may be assigned to another duty in the same judicial district.In the above cases, the persons concerned may not request reassignment for at least two years and, in disciplinary cases, until the minimum term of office has been served in the judicial district to which they have been appointed.Section 8 Œ Transfer on justified groundsﬁIrrespective of the minimum term to be served in a judicial district, a request for transfer may be made on the following grounds:a) healthb) marital situationc) educationd) natural disasters.ﬂSection 13 Œ Transfer following abolishment of courts or postsﬁWhere a court or a post has been abolished, the judge or prosecutor concerned shall be offered a post commensurate with his or her seniority and grade in a court of the same rank. The judge or prosecutor may refuse such an offer. However, in the event of refusal of a subsequent offer, he or she shall be deemed to have resigned.ﬂSection 17 Œ Appointment to the Ministry of Justice or to the position of Rapporteur at the Supreme Administrative Courtﬁ...For the purposes of a transfer to a [regular] judicial office, the term of office spent in the position of rapporteur judge at the Supreme Administrative Court shall be calculated on the basis of the period which that judge would normally have served in the applicable judicial district.ﬂE.Examples of HSYK decisions31.  The Government submitted examples of decisions rendered by the HSYK between 2014 and 2018 on applications made by judges and prosecutors, requesting a review of the decision to transfer them, or objecting to the rejection of such a request. It appears that the HSYK renders decisions collectively and only indicates whether it upholds or  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT12retracts its decision on transfer, without providing any reasons or referring to legal provisions.IV.RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALSA.Council of Europe materials32.  The relevant extracts from the European Charter on the Statute for Judges of 8-10 July 1998 read as follows:ﬁ1.1. The statute for judges aims at ensuring the competence, independence and impartiality which every individual legitimately expects from the courts of law and from every judge to whom is entrusted the protection of his or her rights. It excludes every provision and every procedure liable to impair confidence in such competence, such independence and such impartiality. The present Charter is composed hereafter of the provisions which are best able to guarantee the achievement of those objectives. Its provisions aim at raising the level of guarantees in the various European States. They cannot justify modifications in national statutes tending to decrease the level of guarantees already achieved in the countries concerned.1.2. In each European State, the fundamental principles of the statute for judges are set out in internal norms at the highest level, and its rules in norms at least at the legislative level.1.3. In respect of every decision affecting the selection, recruitment, appointment, career progress or termination of office of a judge, the statute envisages the intervention of an authority independent of the executive and legislative powers within which at least one half of those who sit are judges elected by their peers following methods guaranteeing the widest representation of the judiciary.1.4. The statute gives to every judge who considers that his or her rights under the statute, or more generally his or her independence, or that of the legal process, are threatened or ignored in any way whatsoever, the possibility of making a reference to such an independent authority, with effective means available to it of remedying or proposing a remedy....3.4. A judge holding office at a court may not in principle be appointed to another judicial office or assigned elsewhere, even by way of promotion, without having freely consented thereto. An exception to this principle is permitted only in the case where transfer is provided for and has been pronounced by way of a disciplinary sanction, in the case of a lawful alteration of the court system, and in the case of a temporary assignment to reinforce a neighbouring court, the maximum duration of such assignment being strictly limited by the statute, without prejudice to the application of the provisions at paragraph 1.4 hereof.ﬂ33.  The relevant extracts from the appendix to Recommendation CM Rec (2010)12 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to member States on judges™ independence, efficiency and responsibilities, adopted on 17 November 2010, read:ﬁTenure and irremovability... v. TURKEY JUDGMENT1352. A judge should not receive a new appointment or be moved to another judicial office without consenting to it, except in cases of disciplinary sanctions or reform of the organisation of the judicial system....ﬂ34.  At its 85th Plenary Session (17-18 December 2010), the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) adopted an interim opinion on the Draft Law on the High Council for Judges and Prosecutors (of 27 September 2010) of Turkey. It reads, in so far as relevant:ﬁ50. It is not uncommon in Europe to have some kind of inspection body that supervises judges and/or prosecutors to some extent, to see if they perform their duties correctly. Some countries have such institutions, others manage without them. However, from a comparative perspective it is clear that the powers of the Turkish HSYK to supervise and control the judges and prosecutors are not only greater than in most other European countries, but they have also been traditionally interpreted and applied in such a manner as to exert great influence on core judicial and prosecutorial powers, in a politicised manner that has been quite controversial....76. In addition, as far as disciplinary deliberations are concerned, one could argue that the HSYK is a superior judicial organ and that therefore the provisions of the draft Law on HSYK are in line with European standards, as set out in Principle VI.3 of Recommendation No. R(94)12. However, in the information the Venice Commission received from the Turkish authorities, the HSYK is frequently defined as an administrative body. The position taken by the Venice Commission is that an appeal to a court has to be provided as an additional safeguard of the independence of the judiciary and as a guarantee for the persons concerned. This should apply not only to disciplinary decisions, but also to other decisions which affect the interests and rights of judges and prosecutors.ﬂ35.  At its 86th Plenary Session (25-26 March 2011), the Venice Commission adopted a final opinion on the Draft Law on the High Council for Judges and Prosecutors (of 27 September 2010) of Turkey. It reads, in so far as relevant:ﬁ48. Article 35 deals with appointment to different locations. One of the provisions (which is not amended by the draft Law), allows judges and prosecutors, who have been found unsuccessful in one region, to be transferred to another region. Again, one can see the possible potential for using this as a means of exerting pressure on the individual judge or prosecutor. It would be important that the procedural safeguards for any judge or prosecutor who is to be transferred under compulsion should be set out in the law and the criteria for such transfer clearly stated together with the possibility for the judge or prosecutor affected to answer any case which is made against him or her and to have a right of appeal to a court of law against any decision to transfer....51. Article 46 prohibits the appointment of spouses or certain relatives in close degree to the same Chamber of a court. The third paragraph of this Article is rather curious and again may be due to the translation: v. TURKEY JUDGMENT14ﬁThe ones who are decided to be incapable of working in their current place because of the determination that they cannot function with honour and impartiality or their existence in that place breaches the influence and esteem of the profession upon the prosecution or documental facts without their faults, will be appointed without their consent to another place within the region they are in.ﬂIt is difficult to understand how a person who cannot function with honour or impartiality or whose function breaches the influence and esteem of the judicial or prosecution profession can be regarded as suitable for transfer to another place rather than meriting dismissal....56. Chapter 5 deals with records and appraisal files and professional identity cards. Article 59 provides for the keeping of a confidential record, which includes performance forms, performance evaluation and development forms, which are to be kept in the confidential record.57. Rules should be set to deal with the files on the professional functioning of these judicial officers. It seems that if performance forms and performance evaluation and development forms are to be kept in relation to judges and prosecutors, the judges and prosecutors themselves should be entitled to see those forms and be aware of their contents, and should be entitled to comment on them at the time when they are drawn up....75. Article 71 (which will be extensively amended by the draft Law) provides for the right of a judge or prosecutor to defend himself or herself in disciplinary cases. The Article requires that the judge or prosecutor be informed in a way which includes separately and clearly the actions attributed to him or her, the subject matter of the investigation and the place, time and aspects of the actions which are alleged to have occurred. The judge or prosecutor has the right to require the testimony of the witness and the collection of evidence in his or her favour. They have the right to examine the files in person or through their legal representatives and to receive copies and may also defend themselves orally or in writing before the HSYK or via their legal representatives. These provisions seem clear and appropriate and the amendment is a considerable improvement to the text. The right of defence will be regulated in a more detailed manner, increasing the protection of the judge concerned. Nevertheless, such procedural safeguards in the disciplinary proceeding are not a sufficient substitute for legal remedies against decisions which interfere with subjective rights of judges and the absence of any right of appeal to a court of law is a serious defect in the draft Law.76. The need for provisions that introduce an appeal to a court of law should not be limited to disciplinary sanctions, but should also cover other acts that have negative effects on the status or the activities of judges, for instance: denial of a promotion, adding (negative) comments to files, class allocation, changes of location etc. This might be provided for in other regulations of Turkish law. In a state where the rule of law applies, there is a need for provisions on legal remedies to courts of law in such cases.ﬂ36.  The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) in its Report on ﬁEuropean judicial systems Œ Edition 2014 (2012 data): efficiency and quality of justiceﬂ, published on 9 October 2014, noted the following with respect to the practice of transferring judges in member States: v. TURKEY JUDGMENT15ﬁThe principle that a judge should not be transferred to another court without his/her consent follows from the fundamental principle of irremovability from office. However, in certain circumstances and provided certain legal guarantees are in place, this principle must be reconciled with the need for an effective and efficient system of justice and with modern management practices designed to meet this need (for example, the mobility policies implemented in Belgium and Netherlands). The Venice Commission underlines that ﬁprocedural safeguards for any judge or prosecutor who is to be transferred under compulsion should be set out in the law and the criteria for such transfer clearly stated together with the possibility for the judge or prosecutor affected to answer any case which is made against him or her and to have a right of appeal to a court of law against any decision to transfer.ﬂ (CDL-AD(2011)004, 29 March 2011, § 48). Along the same lines, the CCJE recommends the involvement of an authority independent of the executive and legislative powers, in particular a judicial council, at all stages in judges™ careers (Opinion No. 1 (2001) § 38).Under the European Charter on the Statute for Judges (DAJ/DOC (98) 23, 8-10 July 1998), a judge serving within a given court must in principle not be assigned to another court or have his/her duties changed, even entailing a promotion, without his/her free consent. This applies except where transfer is a disciplinary measure, results from a lawful reorganisation of the court system or takes place on a temporary basis with the purpose of assisting a neighbouring court, in which case the duration of the temporary transfer must be strictly limited (point 3.4).In Andorra, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, Russian Federation and Netherlands, the principle of irremovability is regarded as absolute and no transfer is possible without the consent of the judge concerned. In Monaco, judges cannot be assigned to new duties without their consent.In certain states a transfer can be decided without the judge™s consent for organisational reasons. In this case a transfer safeguard may be provided by law (Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Montenegro, Slovenia, UK-England and Wales) and/or by the involvement of a judicial council (Albania, Croatia, Iceland, Lithuania, Montenegro, Turkey), or again by the possibility of appealing to a competent court (Estonia, ﬁthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedoniaﬂ). In Denmark, only deputy judges can be transferred to another court without their consent for organisational, training or health reasons or because they have proved unsuited to a given post. In Georgia, a transfer without the judge™s consent is possible only in the ﬁinterests of justiceﬂ.A transfer may take place following a disciplinary action. In this case, the safeguard lies in the involvement of the disciplinary authority, more often than not the judicial council (Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Italy, Monaco, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain).ﬂB.United Nations37.  The relevant paragraphs of the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, Mission to Turkey (UN Human Rights Council A/HRC/20/19/Add.3, May 4, 2012), provide as follows:ﬁ40. Concerns were also raised about the mobility system for prosecutors and judges, based on a rotation between different geographical areas classified in various categories. The Special Rapporteur, for instance, was informed of a case where a prosecutor with more than 15 years of experience in criminal cases was transferred ex  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT16officio to work as a family judge in another region. This example, which does not seem to be an isolated one, shows that the transfer and rotation system should be improved and made more effective, fair, transparent and coherent in order to avoid possible misuses in its implementation. A transfer and rotation process that is public, based on objective criteria and, as a general rule, initiated by request would improve trust in the judicial system, especially with regard to those judges and prosecutors dealing with sensitive cases, and would contribute to making them more accountable in their activities.41. There is also the perception that the appointment and transfer system can be used, depending on the case, as a punishment or reward mechanism. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that during an eight-month period beginning 25 October 2010Šthe date the new members of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors took officeŠa total of 3,049 judges and prosecutors changed duty stations, constituting one third of the judges on duty. It was reported that many were transferred ex officio. In this process, judges and prosecutors who were members of judicial professional organizations seem to have been particularly penalized, with little attention being paid to very important issues, such as the right to family integrity.42. The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that there is an urgent need to rationalize the manner in which judges and prosecutors are moved and to make this process more fair and transparent. A decision on the transfer or assignment of judges and prosecutors to other posts cannot be based merely on considerations relating to the needs of service; rather, it should be guided by objective criteria and adequately take into account the individual™s family situation, personal wishes and aspirations as well as the specialization that judges and prosecutors have acquired during their career. Mobility, in particular, cannot be based on arbitrary decisions, and judges and prosecutors should have the right to challengeŠincluding in courtŠall decisions modifying the status of their conditions of service.ﬂC.European Network of Councils for the Judiciary38.  The European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ), in its report of 2012-2013 on minimum standards for the evaluation of professional performance and the irremovability of members of the judiciary, shared the following view:ﬁ...the principle of irremovability extends to the appointment or assignment of a judge to a different office or location without his/her consent (i.e. a judge may not be transferred to a different post or switched to other functions without his/her consent. Nonetheless, there are acceptable exceptions to this general rule when a mandatory transfer of a judge to other duties, court or location has been ordered under specific circumstances as determined by law or otherwise established in a general, abstract manner, including by way of disciplinary sanction or in cases of ascertained inability to perform the judicial functions at the current post in an adequate, independent and impartial manner. This could result, for instance, from disciplinary proceedings that establish improper and unlawful conduct by said judge in that post. It could also result from the presence of objective non-unlawful circumstances that raise questions about the impartiality in the exercise of the judicial function in the office (e.g., personal relationships or kinship with lawyers or other judges who deal with the same cases).The irremovability rule may therefore be outweighed by important reasons connected to the best functioning of the judicial offices as a public interest. In other  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT17words, judicial irremovability should be understood and applied in accordance with the public interest or the public service of justice, the aims of professional evaluation, and the human resource policy regarding the judiciary. In any case the principle of irremovability renders it imperative that the grounds for transfer of judges be clearly established and that a mandatory transfer be decided by means of transparent proceedings conducted by an independent body or authority without any external influences and whose decisions are subject to challenge or review. This helps prevent the authorities from having the power to transfer a judge against his/her will as a means of threatening judicial autonomy and decision-making independence.ﬂD.International Association of Judges39.  At its meeting on 8 October 2015, held in Barcelona, the International Association of Judges issued a resolution where, among other issues, it considered that the arbitrary transfer of thousands of Turkish judges without their consent violated the international standards of judicial independence.THE LAWI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION40.  The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention of his inability to have recourse to a judicial review of the HSYK™s decision of 19 September 2006 dismissing his application for a review of its decision to transfer him to the Sivas Regional Administrative Court.The relevant parts of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention read as follows:ﬁIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.ﬂA.Admissibility1.Applicability ratione materiae(a)The parties™ submissions(i)The Government™s submissions41.  The Government argued that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention could not create, by way of interpretation, a substantive civil right which had no basis in the State concerned. In their view, the relevant domestic law and regulations did not grant judges in Turkey a right to remain in the location of the judicial post to which they were initially or subsequently appointed. In that connection, judges could not rely on a geographical tenure or expect to be transferred to a place of their own choosing, even once they had served their minimum term of office in the three judicial districts. The  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT18Government explained that the rotational system in respect of judges had been set up with a view to addressing geographical inequalities as well as social and cultural barriers that could impair the independence of the profession. In the first place, the rotation system ensured the continuity and quality of the judicial services brought to every part of the country by way of making relevant appointments at particular intervals. Secondly, the system provided for an equitable distribution among the judges. Certain locations which were more desirable than others in terms of social, economic and cultural opportunities could be offered to more judges in a system of rotation than they could in a system without involuntary rotation. Finally, the Government considered that when judges remained in the same place permanently, especially in smaller cities, it became more difficult for them to remain impartial to the local residents on whose disputes they were required to adjudicate and vice versa, in that local residents were prone to forming a perception that a judge stationed too long in a particular court of law tended to lose his or her impartiality.42.  The Government further submitted that the applicant had completed his minimum term of office in the first and second districts, but not in the third judicial district. They seemed to imply that the period during which he had worked as an apprentice judge (see paragraph 4 above) and that of his military service as a legal clerk (see paragraph 7 above) did not count. In that connection, they observed that the amount of time for which the applicant had worked as a rapporteur judge at the Supreme Administrative Court added up to only seven months as opposed to the required amount of five years. However, in any event, they maintained that even if the applicant had completed all three of the minimum terms of office in the respective three districts, he would not have had a right to remain in the location prior to his impugned transfer. The Government further opined that there was no European consensus on the methods of appointment and transfer of judges and prosecutors.43.  With regard to the civil nature of the right alleged, relying on Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC] (no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007-II), the Government argued that both conditions of the test mentioned in that judgment had been met. Concerning the first condition of the test, the domestic law had expressly excluded the HSYK™s decisions from judicial review. In that connection, they referred to the Court™s conclusions in the cases of Apay v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007) and  v. Turkey (no. 20999/04, § 30, 19 October 2010), in which the Court had held that no judicial remedy existed in respect of the HSYK™s decisions. They explained that prior to the constitutional amendment of 2010, the decisions of the HSYK had been excluded from any judicial review, and that after the 2010 amendment, only decisions concerning dismissal from the profession had become amenable to judicial review. They further argued that the HSYK was not a judicial authority and it could  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT19not be considered a ﬁtribunalﬂ for the purposes of that test. According to the Government, that body did not carry out proceedings, it did not hear witnesses and its decision-making procedure was entirely written, except in the case of dismissals, where the defendant judge or prosecutor had a right to submit his observations orally.As regards the second condition of the test, that is the justification of the exclusion from access to a court for the category of staff in question, the Government submitted that the post of judge was a post of the highest grade in the field of administration of justice. Judges wielded power conferred on them by public law and assumed duties to safeguard the general interests of the State. Relying on the conclusions of the Court in Apay (cited above), the Government submitted that the subject matter of the dispute was the exercise of the profession of a judge, which was one of the essential expressions of sovereignty. Therefore, the exclusion of access to a court was justified on objective grounds.(ii)The applicant™s submissions44.  The applicant, referring to the cases of Eskelinen (cited above) and Ohneberg v. Austria (no. 10781/88, 18 September 2012), asserted that Article 6 of the Convention was applicable to his complaint. His case had been an ﬁordinary employment disputeﬂ, first because transfer to another post directly affected the scope of the employment relationship, and secondly, because the transfer had had apparently more to do with his performance and conduct than the organisation of the judiciary across the country. The purported legal basis for the appointment, which was that his performance had been considered to be ﬁaverageﬂ in 2005, had not been disclosed to him at the time of his impugned transfer but had, according to the submissions of the Government, clearly played a role in the HSYK™s decision. Had it not been for the Government™s observations on the admissibility of his case, he would not have had access to the full disclosure of his appraisal report of 2005 or the legal basis for his transfer.45.  The applicant argued that he had a right to remain in the same judicial district. He based his arguments on section 5 of the Regulation on Appointments and section 32 of Law no. 2802 (see paragraphs 24 and 30 above). In his view, those provisions entitled him to remain in the first judicial district for he had acquired the highest grade and had already been holding office in that district prior to his impugned transfer. The applicant further disputed the Government™s arguments that the reason he had been transferred to Sivas had been because he had not completed his minimum term of office in the third judicial district. Giving the initials and registration numbers of his peers with whom he had started his career, he contended that after being appointed to the Ankara administrative, tax and regional courts respectively in 1997, they had all remained there, irrespective of whether they had completed their term of office in the third judicial district or not. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT2046.  The applicant further submitted that the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence did not coincide with the way in which the HSYK decided to transfer judges because of the lack of criteria combined with the lack of transparency in which those decisions were taken. Relying on the Venice Commission™s Interim Opinion on the draft law on Judges and Prosecutors of Turkey (see paragraph 34 above) and the Resolution of the International Association of Judges on the Situation of the Judiciary in Turkey (see paragraph 39 above), he argued that the assignment or transfer of judges and prosecutors to less desirable locations was used as a means of exerting political pressure on individual judges. Without the safeguards of a fair hearing and due process, the system was prone to the use of arbitrary power by the State and was therefore contrary to the rule of law.(b)The Court™s assessment(i)Existence of a right(1)Recapitulation of the case-law47.  The Court reiterates that for the ﬁcivilﬂ limb of Article 6 § 1 to be applicable, there must be a dispute (contestation in the French text) over a ﬁrightﬂ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law, irrespective of whether that right is protected under the Convention. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, lastly, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many other authorities, Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 100, ECHR 2016).48.  Article 6 § 1 does not guarantee any particular content for (civil) ﬁrights and obligationsﬂ in the substantive law of the Contracting States: the Court may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 § 1 a substantive right which has no legal basis in the State concerned (see, for example, Fayed v. the United Kingdom, 21 September 1994, § 65, Series A no. 294-B; Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, § 119, ECHR 2005-X; and Boulois v. Luxembourg [GC], no. 37575/04, § 91, ECHR 2012).49.  The Court™s traditional approach to determining whether there is a ﬁrightﬂ attracting the application of Article 6 is based on the distinction between the substantive content of the right invoked and possible procedural obstacles to obtaining judicial protection thereof (see Roche, cited above, § 119). Whether a person has an actionable domestic claim may depend not only on the content, properly speaking, of the relevant civil right as defined under national law, but also on the existence of procedural bars preventing or limiting the possibilities of bringing potential claims to court (see Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v. Romania [GC], no. 76943/11, § 87,  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT2129 November 2016). In the latter kind of case Article 6 § 1 may be applicable (see Petko Petkov v. Bulgaria, no. 2834/06, § 26, 19 February 2013, with further reference to Al-Adsani v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35763/97, § 47, ECHR 2001-XII).50.  By implication, Article 6 remains inapplicable where it is clear beyond argument that no right exists in domestic law (see Sultana v. Malta (dec.), no. 970/04, 11 December 2007). Such is the case where a person™s rights under the domestic legislation are limited to a mere hope of being granted a right, with the actual grant of that right depending on an entirely discretionary and unreasoned decision of the authorities (see Regner v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 35289/11, § 103, 19 September 2017).51.  However, there are also situations where the national law, while not necessarily recognising that an individual has a subjective right, does confer the right to a lawful procedure for examination of his or her claim, involving matters such as ruling whether a decision was arbitrary or ultra vires or whether there were procedural irregularities (see Regner, cited above, § 105, with further reference to Van Marle and Others v. the Netherlands, 26 June 1986, § 35, Series A no. 101, and, mutatis mutandis, Kök v. Turkey, no. 1855/02, § 36, 19 October 2006). This is the case as regards certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, with the law conferring on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which, where they find that the decision was unlawful, may set it aside. In such a case Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is applicable, on condition that the advantage or privilege, once granted, gives rise to a civil right (see Regner, cited above, § 105).52.  Lastly, it would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 § 1 Œ namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication Œ if, for example, a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on large groups or categories of persons (see Fayed, § 65, and Al-Adsani, § 47, both cited above).(2)Application of these principles to the present case53.  The Court wishes to make it clear at the outset that it is not its role to determine the question whether the impugned transfer of the applicant was justified at the time. It further reiterates that it is not its role to pronounce on the appropriateness of the rotational system in place for judges and prosecutors in Turkey. In the determination of whether there existed a legal basis for the right relied on by the applicant, the Court needs to ascertain only whether the applicant™s arguments were sufficiently tenable, not whether he would necessarily have won had he had access to a court (see, inter alia, Neves e Silva v. Portugal, 27 April 1989, § 37, Series A no. 153- v. TURKEY JUDGMENT22A). In so doing, the Court must have regard to the wording of the relevant legal provisions and to their interpretation, if any, by the domestic courts (see Yanakiev v. Bulgaria, no. 40476/98, § 58, 10 August 2006). The Court nevertheless reiterates that the concept of ﬁcivil rights and obligationsﬂ is an autonomous concept deriving from the Convention which cannot be interpreted solely by reference to the respondent State™s domestic law (see König v. Germany, 28 June 1978, §§ 88-89, Series A no. 27, and Naït-Liman v. Switzerland [GC], no. 51357/07, § 106, 15 March 2018). In that connection, in its assessment of whether there existed a ﬁrightﬂ that an applicant can rely on arguable grounds, the Court takes domestic provisions as a starting point only (see, among many other authorities, Denisov, cited above, § 45) and may rely on international norms to assess or enhance the interpretation of the existence of a right (see, for example, Enea v  Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, § 101, ECHR 2009; Boulois, cited above, §§ 91 and 101-102; and Naït-Liman, cited above, § 108).54.  In order to determine whether the applicant had a right in the present case, the Court must first analyse the actual nature of his complaint before the domestic authorities. In that connection, the Court reiterates that it is the right as asserted by the claimant in the domestic proceedings that must be taken into account in order to assess whether Article 6 § 1 is applicable (see Stichting Mothers of Srebrenica and Others v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 65542/12, § 120, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).55.  The applicant complained before the HSYK that the decision to transfer him to Sivas had been unjustified and did not comply with the guarantee of judicial independence (see paragraph 13 above). He argued that his consecutive transfers within the previous two years had appeared arbitrary, as no pressing reasons or other grounds had been cited by the HSYK. Moreover, he argued that he had a right to remain in Ankara, firstly because, as a first-grade judge serving in the first judicial district and having completed his minimum term of service in the other judicial districts, he had a right not to be removed from the first district against his will. Secondly, he relied on his right to family union. In his submission, he explained that he had been unable to move his entire family with him to Sivas, as his children were enrolled in private schools of their choice and his wife was employed in the private sector. He maintained in that connection that his private and family life had been substantially affected as a consequence of his transfer.56.  The Court reiterates that although there is in principle no right under the Convention to hold a public post entailing the administration of justice (see Dzhidzheva Trendafilova v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 12628/09, § 38, 9 October 2012, and contrast Zalli, cited above; and concerning tenured judicial positions, Baka, cited above, § 107; Denisov, cited above, § 47, and Kövesi v. Romania, no. 3594/19, § 113, 5 May 2020), such a right may exist at the domestic level. The Court further notes that the applicant did not claim a right to hold judicial office in a particular court of law, which is  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT23clearly not a right recognised as such in domestic law, but rather complained of the arbitrary nature of his transfer resulting in his removal from the first judicial district without any grounds being disclosed and the prejudice he had suffered in his professional and personal life as a result.57.  The case therefore concerns, from the standpoint of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a member of the judiciary™s right of access to a court and his right to a fair procedure in order to complain about the legitimacy of his non-consensual transfer, which undoubtedly affected the conditions of his employment and had an impact on his family life. Thus, in the determination of whether the applicant could arguably rely on a ﬁrightﬂ so as to bring into play the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention, the issue is not whether in a judicial system, such as that at issue in the present case, the right to a geographical guarantee can be demanded, but whether there is an arguable basis on which the right to be protected against an arbitrary transfer can be claimed.58.  It should not be forgotten in this regard that the Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a State governed by the rule of law, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties (see Baka, cited above, § 165, with further references). This consideration, set out in particular in cases concerning the right of judges to freedom of expression (see, as a recent example, Guz v. Poland, no. 965/12, § 86, 15 October 2020) has been found to be equally relevant in relation to the adoption of measures affecting the right to liberty of members of the judiciary (see Alparslan Altan v. Turkey, no. 12778/17, § 102, 16 April 2019, and  v. Turkey, no. 66448/17, § 144, 3 March 2020). The Court sees no reason why this consideration should not also be applied in cases concerning the right of access to a court for members of the judiciary in matters concerning their status or career. Since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must interpret and apply it in a manner which renders its rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory. The Convention must also be read as a whole, and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions (see, among other authorities, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, §§ 47-48, ECHR 2005-X, and N.D. and N.T. v. Spain [GC], nos. 8675/15 and 8697/15, § 172, 13 February 2020). Given the prominent place that the judiciary occupies among State organs in a democratic society and the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá v. Portugal [GC], nos. 55391/13 and 2 others, § 196, 6 November 2018), the Court must be particularly attentive to the protection of members of the judiciary against measures affecting their status or career that can threaten their judicial independence and autonomy. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT2459.  It is with these considerations in mind that the Court will examine the specific circumstances of the present case.60.  As regards the provisions of domestic law, the Court notes that Article 140 of the Turkish Constitution provides for a safeguard in that matters relating to the status of judges, including changes in their posts or places of duty, should be regulated by legislation in accordance with the principles of independence of the courts and the security of tenure of judges. There can therefore be no doubt that judges may claim, on the basis of the constitutional protection afforded to them, that the principles of independence of the judiciary and the security of tenure of judges should be fully complied with in measures affecting their status or career, including those concerning transfers, and that the legal provisions emanating from Parliament and providing for the specific criteria to be respected in deciding on transfers act as an additional safeguard against arbitrariness or the improper use of discretion.61.  In that connection, the Court observes that there are only three types of non-consensual transfer providing for redeployment in a lower district, which are set out in the Judges and Prosecutors Act. These are: firstly, appointment by way of transfer to a lower district, linked to the condition of failure in the performance of duties on the basis of documents (section 35); secondly, particular situations of transfer linked to an investigation or a report revealing a failure in the performance of duties with the requisite expeditiousness (section 46); thirdly, transfer to a lower district as a disciplinary sanction (section 68). The first two types of transfer cannot be imposed unless the inadequate performance is substantiated by a report or an investigation, whereas the third type of transfer can only be imposed as a disciplinary penalty following a disciplinary process. When these provisions are read in the light of the constitutional guarantee mentioned above, it cannot be argued that the domestic framework gave the HSYK unfettered discretion in respect of the transfer of judges so as to allow it to step outside of the limited situations for which a transfer may be called for. In addition, in the specific case of the applicant, who was a first-grade judge and serving in the highest (first) judicial district prior to his impugned transfer, section 5 of the Regulations on Appointment could be said to have created a legitimate expectation to remain in the first judicial district contingent on performance and conduct. On this basis also, the applicant, whose performance and conduct were not called into question, and who in any case was not duly apprised of the reasons for his transfer, could argue that his transfer was not in compliance with the provisions of domestic law. In these circumstances, and in so far as the factual or legal basis for the applicant™s transfer was not disclosed to him, the applicant could legitimately suspect an element of arbitrariness in his transfer and this provided an arguable basis on which the right to be protected against arbitrary transfer could be claimed. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT2562.  As to whether the principles of international law or common values of the Council of Europe can be relied on to enhance the interpretation of domestic law as to the existence of such a right, the Court reiterates that the consensus emerging from specialised international instruments and the practice of Contracting States may constitute a relevant consideration when it interprets the provisions of the Convention in specific cases (see Demir and Baykara v. Turkey [GC], no. 34503/97, § 85, ECHR 2008). The Court further points out that in a number of judgments, it has used, for the purpose of interpreting the Convention, intrinsically non-binding instruments of Council of Europe organs, in particular recommendations and resolutions of the Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary Assembly, as well as norms emanating from other organs of the Council of Europe, whether supervisory mechanisms or expert bodies which do not have the function of representing States Parties to the Convention (ibid., §§ 74-75, and the cases cited therein). In the case of Enea (cited above, §§ 101 and 103), which concerned the applicability of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention under its civil limb to the decision to place the applicant under a special prison regime and the restrictions likely to accompany it, the Court referred to the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers concerning the European Prison Rules in finding that a ﬁrightﬂ could be said to have been recognised under domestic law. In the case of Boulois (cited above, § 102), the Court concluded that no right to prison leave existed either in domestic or international law, highlighting the fact that such a right was not recognised under any principle of international law that the applicant had relied on and that no European consensus existed on the matter.63.  Turning to the circumstances of the instant case and having regard to the international materials cited in paragraphs 32-38 above in a non-exhaustive manner, the Court observes at the outset that objective criteria accompanied by a transparent process are regarded as the standard in the selection, appointment and promotion of judges as a safeguard of judicial independence and autonomy, so as to avoid arbitrary interference or the improper use of discretion. The Court also considers relevant the principles established in its recent judgment in Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson v. Iceland [GC] (no. 26374/18, §§ 218-234, 1 December 2020) concerning the consequences of an irregular appointment of a judge on the scope of the right to a ﬁtribunal established by lawﬂ. The Court considered that judges should be selected on the basis of merit and objective criteria not only to ensure public confidence in judiciary but also to supplement the guarantee of the personal independence of judges (ibid., § 222). In that connection it referred to paragraph 25 of Opinion. No. 1 (2001) of the CCJE, which recommends that ﬁthe authorities responsible in member States for making and advising on appointments and promotions should now introduce, publish and give effect to objective criteria, with the aim of ensuring that the selection and career of judges are based on merit, having regard to  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT26qualifications, integrity, ability and efficiencyﬂ (ibid., § 221). At the same time, the Grand Chamber considered it necessary for the domestic law to be couched in unequivocal terms, to the extent possible, so as not to allow arbitrary interferences in the appointment process, including by the executive (ibid., § 230). The Court considers these principles of international law on the appointment of judges to be equally valid in the case of their transfers. Furthermore, the European Charter on the Statute for Judges, despite being non-binding on the member States, provides for a right of appeal for any judge who considers that his or her rights under the statute, or more generally independence, or that of the legal process are threatened or infringed. In the specific context of transfers against the will of the judge concerned, the Charter reinforces the principle of irremovability, save for the very limited exceptions mentioned therein, and in any event recognises the general right of appeal before an independent authority, which can investigate the legitimacy of the transfer (see paragraph 32 above and the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers 2010(12) in paragraph 33 above). Likewise, the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary considers that the principle of irremovability of judges renders it imperative that the grounds for transfer of judges be clearly established and that a mandatory transfer be decided by means of transparent proceedings conducted by an independent body or authority without any external influences and whose decisions are subject to challenge or review (see paragraph 38 above).Against this background and without calling into question the legitimacy of existing systems for the appointment and transfer of judges in the member States, the Court can observe that the right of a member of the judiciary to protection against an arbitrary transfer or appointment is supported by international norms as a corollary of judicial independence.64.  In the light of the above considerations, it follows that a dispute (contestation) over a ﬁrightﬂ for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 can be said to have existed in the instant case. It remains to be determined whether the nature of the right in question was civil.(ii)Civil nature of the right(1)Recapitulation of the case-law65.  It should be noted that the scope of the ﬁcivilﬂ concept in Article 6 is not limited by the immediate subject matter of the dispute. Instead, the Court has developed a wider approach, according to which the ﬁcivilﬂ limb has covered cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private pecuniary or non-pecuniary right belonging to an individual. Through this approach, the civil limb of Article 6 has been applied to a variety of disputes which may have been classified in domestic law as public-law disputes (see  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT27Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, § 51, 25 September 2018). These examples include disciplinary proceedings concerning the right to practise a profession (see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, §§ 47 and 48, Series A no. 43, and Philis v. Greece (no. 2), 27 June 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV), disputes involving the right to a healthy environment (see  and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, § 133, ECHR 2004X), prisoners™ detention arrangements (see Ganci v. Italy, no. 41576/98, § 25, ECHR 2003-XI, and Enea v. Italy (cited above, § 103) as well as the right of a prisoner to confidential face-to-face conversation with a lawyer outside the context of a criminal trial (see Altay v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 11236/09, § 68, 9 April 2019), the right of access to investigation documents (see Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 38773/05, §§ 143-45, 26 July 2012), disputes regarding the non-inclusion of a conviction in a criminal record (see Alexandre v. Portugal, no. 33197/09, §§ 54 and 55, 20 November 2012), proceedings for the application of a non-custodial preventive measure (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 154, ECHR 2017 (extracts)), the revocation of a civil servant™s security clearance within the Ministry of Defence (see Regner, cited above, §§ 113-27).66.  In cases of employment disputes concerning civil servants, the Court applies a two-tier test, which it established in its Grand Chamber judgment in Vilho Eskelinen (cited above Œ hereinafter referred to as the ﬁEskelinen testﬂ). In order for the respondent State to be able to rely before the Court on the applicant™s status as a civil servant in excluding the protection embodied in Article 6, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the State in its national law must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question. Secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State™s interest. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists a ﬁspecial bond of trust and loyaltyﬂ between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond (ibid., §§ 102-03). Thus, there can in principle be no justification for the exclusion from the guarantees of Article 6 of ordinary labour disputes, such as those relating to salaries, allowances or similar entitlements, on the basis of the special nature of the relationship between the particular civil servant and the State in question (ibid., § 103). There will, in effect, be a presumption that Article 6 applies. It will be for the respondent Government to demonstrate, firstly, that a civil servant applicant does not have a right of access to a court under national law and, secondly, that the exclusion of the rights under Article 6 for the civil servant is justified (ibid., § 103). v. TURKEY JUDGMENT2867.  The Court reiterates that an applicant may not be excluded from the protection of Article 6 of the Convention solely on account of his or her status as a judge. It recalls that in its Grand Chamber judgment in the case of Baka (cited above), it confirmed the approach taken in a number of Chamber judgments that the Eskelinen test applied to disputes concerning judges, as the judiciary, albeit not part of the ordinary civil service, is considered part of typical public service (ibid., § 104). This covered all types of disputes, including those relating to recruitment/appointment, career/promotion, transfer and termination of service/dismissal (ibid., § 105).68.  On the basis of the principles set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, Article 6 has been applied to employment disputes involving judges who were dismissed from judicial office (see, for example, Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, §§ 91 and 96, ECHR 2013; Kulykov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 5114/09 and 17 others, §§ 118 and 132, 19 January 2017; Sturua v. Georgia, no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017; and Kamenos v. Cyprus, no. 147/07, § 88, 31 October 2017), removed from an administrative position without the termination of their duties as a judge (see Baka, §§ 34 and 107-11, and Denisov, §§  25, 47-48 and 54, both cited above) or suspended from judicial office (see Paluda v. Slovakia, no. 33392/12, § 34, 23 May 2017) or otherwise subjected to a disciplinary sanction (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, §§ 119-20). It has also been applied to employment disputes involving civil servants who had lost a remote-area allowance which had been added to their salaries as a bonus (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, §§ 40 and 41) or who had been transferred to another office or post against their will, resulting in a decrease in salary (see Zalli v. Albania (dec.), no. 52531/07, 8 February 2011, and Ohneberg, cited above). Furthermore, in Bayer v. Germany (no. 8453/04, 16 July 2009), which concerned the removal from office of a State-employed bailiff following disciplinary proceedings, the Court held that disputes about ﬁsalaries, allowances or similar entitlementsﬂ were only non-exhaustive examples of ﬁordinary labour disputesﬂ to which Article 6 should in principle apply under the Vilho Eskelinen test (ibid., § 38; see also Regner, cited above, § 108). Therefore, it is clear that the criteria set out in under the Eskelinen test do not exclude the applicability of Article 6 § 1 to ﬁordinary labour disputesﬂ involving members of the judiciary.(2)Application of these principles to the present case69.  As regards the question whether the subject-matter of the dispute qualified as ﬁcivilﬂ within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, the Court notes firstly that, in contrast to the cases concerning transfer of judges cited above, the applicant™s transfer did not entail any direct pecuniary effects such as a reduction in salary or a loss of allowances. Although the applicant maintained in the context of his claim for just satisfaction that he  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT29had incurred additional expenses on account of having been transferred to another district (see paragraph 99 below), these were indirect and incidental consequences of the very fact of having to move to a different location, and the Court does not consider that they gave rise to a civil right or obligation as such. Secondly, while civil rights and obligations are not necessarily dependent on pecuniary consequences and may arise, for example, when the measure affects private or family life, the Court recalls that the applicant™s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention was declared inadmissible by the President of the Section acting as a single judge. Consequently, the alleged effects of the transfer on the applicant™s private and family life cannot constitute a basis for finding that the transfer affected his civil rights and obligations in that respect either. Nevertheless, the Court reiterates that disputes about ﬁsalaries, allowances or similar entitlementsﬂ are only non-exhaustive examples of ﬁordinary labour disputesﬂ to which Article 6 should in principle apply (see paragraph 68 above) and that a public-law dispute may bring the civil limb into play if the private-law aspects predominate over the public law ones in view of the direct consequences for a civil pecuniary or non-pecuniary right (see Denisov, cited above, § 53, emphasis added). Thus, bearing in mind the presumption that Article 6 applies to ﬁordinary labour disputesﬂ and taking into account that the applicant™s transfer had considerable effects on his professional life and career and that it was a unilateral measure relating to the employment relationship which was neither insignificant nor a mere formality, the Court considers that it would be artificial to exclude the dispute at issue from the protection of Article 6 on the basis that it did not relate either to direct pecuniary consequences or to private and family life matters.70.  The Court will next examine whether the dispute over the transfer could nevertheless be excluded from the protection of Article 6 of the Convention on the basis of the conditions set out in the Eskelinen test. In the majority of those cases where the Court applied the Eskelinen test, the Court found that the first condition, that is, whether national law ﬁexpressly excludedﬂ access to a court for the post or category of staff in question, had not been fulfilled and that Article 6 was thus applicable to the proceedings in question (see Kamenos, cited above, § 73). By contrast, only in a minority of cases did the Court consider that the first condition had been fulfilled. Those cases concerned disciplinary action taken against judges and prosecutors before the HSYK. The Court ruled that the first condition had been fulfilled because domestic law had expressly excluded access to a court and therefore Article 6 did not apply (see Nazsiz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 22412/05, 26 May 2009, concerning the disciplinary dismissal of a public prosecutor, and , cited above, § 30, concerning a judge™s removal from office on disciplinary grounds).71.  That being so, it must be borne in mind that since its review of the HSYK in those cases, the Court has developed a more nuanced approach in  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT30determining whether a particular domestic body, outside the domestic judiciary, could be regarded as a ﬁcourtﬂ for the purposes of the Eskelinen test. For example, it has noted that the mere fact that a further judicial review of a body™s decision was not permitted in domestic law did not necessarily mean that the national law excluded access to a court. Therefore, in the light of developments in its case-law with respect to the criteria as to what constitutes a ﬁcourtﬂ for the purposes of the Eskelinen test (see Kamenos, cited above, §§ 75-79), the Court must carry out a fresh examination as to whether the HSYK can be considered to be a ﬁtribunalﬂ fulfilling a judicial function.72.  The Court will examine the structure and functioning of the HSYK as it was regulated in domestic law at the time of the events. It will therefore not take into account the subsequent developments in the Constitution or successive legal instruments.73.  The Court reiterates that for the purposes of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated with the standard judicial machinery (see Rolf Gustafson v. Sweden, 1 July 1997, § 45, Reports 1997-IV) since a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, is characterised, in the substantive sense of the term, by its judicial function, that is to say, to determine matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner. A power of decision is inherent in the very notion of ﬁtribunalﬂ. The procedure before it must ensure the ﬁdetermination of the matters in disputeﬂ as required by Article 6 § 1 (see Benthem v. the Netherlands, 23 October 1985, § 40, Series A no. 97). In addition, only an institution that has full jurisdiction and satisfies a number of requirements, such as independence from the executive and also from the parties, merits the designation ﬁtribunalﬂ within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (see Beaumartin v. France, 24 November 1994, § 38, Series A no. 296B; Di Giovanni v. Italy, no. 51160/06, § 52, 9 July 2013; and, most recently, Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, § 218).74.  Turning to the structure and functioning of the HSYK at the relevant time, it is beyond doubt that it had exclusive jurisdiction and power of decision in matters concerning the organisation of the judiciary, the career of judges and prosecutors, and disciplinary proceedings. Moreover, in respect of its decisions concerning judges and prosecutors, a review and objection mechanism was provided for by law. That being so, the Court observes that the manner in which that body made decisions in review and objection proceedings was not prescribed by a set of procedural rules. The Court observes that neither Law no. 2461 nor the internal regulation of 1988, applicable at the time of the events (see paragraph 28 above), contained specific rules on the procedure to be followed or safeguards to be provided to claimants before the HSYK, or on how evidence was to be admitted and assessed. Secondly, the HSYK did not provide for an  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT31adversarial process as it did not hold hearings, summon or hear witnesses. Thirdly, the decisions delivered by the HSYK after a claimant had applied for a review or filed an objection in respect of his or her transfer contained no reasons, which implies that decisions were not made on the basis of legal principles (see paragraph 31 above). The foregoing constitutes a sufficient basis for finding that the HSYK did not fulfil a judicial function, without it being necessary to examine further whether it complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality.75.  It therefore follows that at the time of the events the HSYK did not qualify as a ﬁcourtﬂ within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and that domestic law expressly excluded the possibility of an appeal against the HSYK™s decision to a ﬁcourtﬂ. The first condition of the Eskelinen test, exclusion of access to a court for the category of post in question, is therefore satisfied.76.  The Court must next assess whether the second criterion established in the Eskelinen case was met, namely, whether the justification was based on objective grounds for exclusion in the State™s interest. The mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists a ﬁspecial bond of trust and loyaltyﬂ between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is for the State to show that the subject of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the ﬁspecial bond of trust and loyaltyﬂ between the civil servant and the State, as employer (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, § 62).77.  The Court has only had a few cases where it has been required to examine the applicability of Article 6 § 1 under the second criterion of the Eskelinen test. In Suküt v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 59773/00, 11 September 2007), which concerned the early retirement of an army officer on disciplinary grounds, the Court held that the exclusion had been justified because the subject matter of the dispute concerned the applicant™s discharge from the army for his failure to comply with military discipline and the principle of secularism. The Court thus held that calling into question the ﬁspecial bond of trust and loyaltyﬂ between the applicant and the State, as his employer, had been central to the dispute.78.  In a case concerning the inability of the applicants to contest the revocation of their security clearance which had resulted in the first applicant™s dismissal and the second applicant™s transfer to another post, the Court found the second condition of the Eskelinen test to have been satisfied (see  and  v. Latvia ((dec.), nos. 2631/10 and 12253/10, 18 November 2014). In coming to that conclusion, the Court attached importance to the fact that the applicants had held high-ranking posts in the administration Œ the first applicant had been responsible for intelligence and  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT32counter-intelligence, while the second applicant held one of the highest posts in the State Revenue Service and was in charge of the Customs Criminal Investigation Department. The nature of their posts and the duties they were entrusted with demonstrated that they participated directly Œ and not incidentally Œ in the exercise of State power and had a special duty of discretion towards the State. In as much as the subject matter of the dispute and the circumstances leading to the revocation of their security clearance concerned the calling into question of their reliability and ability not to disclose State secrets, the Court found the exclusion of their dispute from the guarantees of Article 6 to be reasonably justified.79.  The Court notes that the above line of case-law, which concerned an army officer and high-ranking civil servants, all of whom were hierarchically attached to the executive branch of the State, cannot be transposed to the circumstances of the present case, which concerns a member of the judiciary. In the Court™s view, the criterion that the subject matter of the dispute has to be related to the calling into question of the special bond of trust and loyalty must be read in the light of the guarantees for the independence of the judiciary. In the opinion of the Court, those two notions, namely the special bond of trust and loyalty required from civil servants and the independence of the judiciary, cannot be easily reconciled. While the employment relationship between a civil servant and the State can traditionally be defined as one based on trust and loyalty to the executive branch in so far as employees of the State are required to implement government policies, the same does not hold true for the members of the judiciary, who play a different and more independent role because of their duty to provide checks on government wrong-doing and abuse of power. Their employment relationship with the State must therefore be understood in the light of the specific guarantees essential for judicial independence. Thus when referring to the special trust and loyalty that they must observe, it is loyalty to the rule of law and democracy and not to holders of State power. This complex aspect of the employment relationship between a judge and the State makes it necessary for members of the judiciary to be sufficiently distanced from other branches of the State in the performance of their duties, so that they can render decisions a fortiori based on the requirements of law and justice, without fear or favour. It would be a fallacy to assume that judges can uphold the rule of law and give effect to the Convention if domestic law deprives them of the guarantees of the Articles of the Convention on matters directly touching their individual independence and impartiality. Senior members of the judiciary should enjoy Œ as other citizens Œ protection from arbitrariness from the executive power and only oversight by an independent judicial body of the legality of such a removal decision is able to render such a right effective (see Kövesi, cited above, § 124). For these reasons, the Court does not consider it justified to exclude members of the judiciary from the protection of  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT33Article 6 of the Convention in matters concerning the conditions of their employment on the basis of the special bond of loyalty and trust to the State.80.  Secondly, at the time when the HSYK decided to transfer the applicant to the Sivas Regional Administrative Court and in its subsequent rejection of his request for a review of the decision to transfer him, no reasons other than a short reference to the ﬁneeds of the serviceﬂ were given. The fact that the HSYK™s decision contained no details on how the needs of service had been assessed, what objective criteria had been employed and why, in particular, the applicant™s objections were refused, leads to the conclusion that the dispute did not concern any exceptional or compelling reasons that could justify its exclusion from a judicial review. Although the Government argued in retrospect that the applicant™s transfer had had to do with his appraisal score of 2005 and the comments made therein, as well as the fact that he had not served his full-term in the third judicial district, the Court is unable to draw any definite conclusions from those arguments, which are merely speculative in the absence of the HSYK™s own reasoning. Even if that were the case, it is clear that those grounds involved ordinary aspects of an employment relationship and did not disclose any aspect of the use of sovereign power in particular.81.  The Court therefore does not accept the Government™s plea that the exclusion of a judicial review of the decision on the applicant™s transfer can be justified on the basis of the exercise of State sovereignty. It therefore follows that Article 6 is applicable ratione materiae to the present case.2.Exhaustion of remedies(a)The parties™ submissions(i)The Government™s submissions82.  The Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust relevant domestic remedies as he had not filed an objection with the Objections Board against the decision of the HSYK to dismiss his request for a review of the decision to transfer him to Sivas. They explained that the Objections Board had carried out its examination in accordance with the Constitution and the law, the general principles of law, and the principles of independence of the courts and tenure of judges. In their view, an objection filed with that body could not be dismissed as irrelevant, because a different rapporteur would be assigned to the case. Moreover, the composition of the Objections Board was not the same as that of the original body deciding on the request for a review in so far as the former included substitute members. The Government also submitted certain decisions where the Objections Board had reversed the decision on transfer; they therefore considered that the remedy offered reasonable prospects of success. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT3483.  The Government further argued that the applicant could have contested his appraisal score for the year 2005 by bringing an action for annulment before the administrative courts, but that he had failed to do so.(ii)The applicant™s submissions84.  The applicant argued that an application to the Objections Board could not be considered an effective remedy because the original HSYK members who had decided on his request for a review had sat on the Objections Board and had constituted the majority. He had not therefore had to exhaust that remedy in respect of his impugned transfer. In any event, the Court had considered that remedy to be ineffective in the cases of Özpinar (cited above, §§ 85-86) and Kayasu v. Turkey (nos. 64119/00 and 76292/01, § 121, 13 November 2008).85.  As regards his appraisal record, the applicant did not comment on whether an action before the administrative courts could have been an effective remedy in respect of his transfer.(b)The Court™s assessment86.  The Court refers, first of all, to the general principles concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies as summarised in  and Others v. Serbia ((preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, §§ 69-77, 25 March 2014). In particular, Article 35 § 1 of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of remedies which are relevant to the impugned violations, available and adequate.87.  In the present case, the Court has found that the HSYK could not be considered a tribunal, in particular because of the absence of a specific set of procedural rules to be employed in the proceedings before it. Furthermore, the Court has found, in the context of a complaint under Articles 8 and 10 in conjunction with Article 13 of the Convention, that an objection before the Objections Board could not be considered an effective remedy, in particular because those who had rendered the original decision which was the subject of the objection sat on the Objections Board (see Kayasu and , both cited above).88.  In the light of the above considerations and having regard to the fact that the applicant™s complaint relates to his inability to seek a judicial review of the HSYK™s decision of 16 September 2006, the Government™s objection of non-exhaustion under this head must be dismissed.89.  As regards the Government™s remaining objection of non-exhaustion of remedies, the Court notes that neither the applicant™s transfer nor the HSYK™s decision to dismiss his request for a review was officially linked to the applicant™s appraisal of 2005. Furthermore, the contents of the appraisal had not been disclosed to the applicant and were classified by operation of the law (see paragraphs 12, 14, 19, 21 and 24). In these circumstances the  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT35Court fails to see how the applicant could have been expected to make a causal link between his impugned transfer and his appraisal report so as to challenge the latter in order to reverse his transfer. The Court therefore rejects the Government™s objection on non-exhaustion under this head also.(c)Conclusion as to admissibility90.  The Court notes that the application is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible.B.Merits91.  The parties have not made any separate observations other than those summarised above.92.  The Court reiterates that the right of access to a court Œ that is, the right to institute proceedings before the courts in civil matters Œ constitutes an element which is inherent in the right set out in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which lays down the guarantees applicable as regards both the organisation and composition of the court, and the conduct of the proceedings. All of those elements make up the right to a fair trial secured by Article 6 § 1 (see Baka, cited above, § 120).93.  The right to a fair hearing, as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, must be construed in the light of the rule of law, which requires that all litigants should have an effective judicial remedy enabling them to assert their civil rights (see, among other authorities,  v. Turkey, no. 59601/09, § 18, 17 September 2013, and Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc. v. Switzerland [GC], no. 5809/08, § 126, ECHR 2016). Everyone has the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way, Article 6 § 1 embodies the ﬁright to a courtﬂ, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, is one particular aspect (see, inter alia, Naït-Liman v. Switzerland, cited above, § 113).94.  In that regard, the Court reiterates that the right of access to a court is not absolute. Where the individual™s access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the Court will examine whether the limitation imposed impaired the essence of the right and, in particular, whether it pursued a legitimate aim and whether there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved. If the restriction is compatible with these principles, no violation of Article 6 will arise (see Baka, cited above, § 120).95.  In the present case, the decision to transfer the applicant was not reviewed, nor was it open to review, by an ordinary tribunal or other body exercising judicial powers. That restriction stemmed from the constitutional prohibition on judicial review of the HSYK™s decisions; therefore the  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT36absence of a judicial review was lawful in terms of domestic law. As to the legitimacy of the aim pursued by the restriction, the Government submitted that if each and every compulsory transfer were to be contested in judicial review proceedings, it would place an unsustainable strain on the functioning of the judicial system and would render the compulsory rotational system meaningless.96.  The question before the Court is not whether a particular system or method of transfer or appointment of judges is to be preferred over another one, but is limited to whether the complete absence of a judicial review of the non-voluntary transfer of a judge is compatible with the rule of law and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Court stresses the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, § 196). It further notes the existing consensus on the necessity to have in place procedural safeguards and the possibility of appeal against decisions affecting the career, including the status, of a judge (see paragraphs 32, 36, 38 and 63 above). Furthermore, various international reports express concern about the improper use of the transfer mechanism in Turkey against judges, which is exacerbated further by the fact that no judicial remedy is available for such measures (see paragraphs 34-35, 37 and 39 above). Lastly, the potential inconvenience of having numerous claimants contesting their transfer cannot outweigh their right to have the courts determine their civil rights and obligations. In view of the important role that judges play in securing Convention rights, it is imperative that there exist procedural safeguards in order to ensure that their judicial autonomy is not jeopardised by undue external or internal influences. What is also at stake is public trust in the functioning of the judiciary. In matters concerning their career, as in the present case where a unilateral decision was taken against a judge calling for his transfer, there should be weighty reasons exceptionally justifying the absence of a judicial review, which have not been provided to the Court in this case.97.  In view of the foregoing considerations, the Court concludes that the applicant™s lack of access to a court did not pursue any legitimate aim and that, accordingly, the very essence of that right was impaired (see, mutatis mutandis, Baka, cited above, § 121).There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION98.  Article 41 of the Convention provides: v. TURKEY JUDGMENT37ﬁIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.ﬂA.Damage99.  The applicant claimed 98,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage. He argued that as a result of the impugned transfer, he had reluctantly retired prematurely from his post. However, had the decision to transfer him been revoked, he would have continued to work in the Ankara Regional Court for another ten years. The amount of pecuniary damage claimed by the applicant corresponded to the salary and benefits he would have allegedly received. That amount also included the cost of maintaining two residences and travel expenses during the fifteen-month period when he had worked at the Sivas Regional Court.100.  The applicant also claimed EUR 75,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage sustained on account of the emotional distress that he and his family had suffered. He argued in that connection that as a result of his impugned transfer, his professional career and reputation had suffered.101.  The Government considered that there was no causal link between the damage claimed by the applicant and the violation alleged. In any event, they considered that the sums claimed were unsubstantiated and excessive.102.  The Court has found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the absence of a judicial review of the HSYK™s decision of 16 September 2006 on the applicant™s request for a review of their decision to transfer him. It reiterates that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings complained of would have been had the violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention not occurred (see, mutatis mutandis, Ohneberg, cited above, § 38). Therefore, it rejects the applicant™s claim in respect of pecuniary damage.103.  As regards non-pecuniary damage, the Court reiterates that its guiding principle is equity, which above all involves flexibility and an objective consideration of what is just, fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, including not only the position of the applicant, but the overall context in which the breach occurred. Its non-pecuniary awards serve to give recognition to the fact that moral damage occurred as a result of a breach of a fundamental human right and reflect in the broadest of terms the severity of the damage (see Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], nos. 16064/90 and 8 others, § 224, ECHR 2009, and the cases cited therein). The Court considers that, in the present case, the applicant must have suffered a certain amount of distress on account of his consecutive transfers against his consent, and without due process of law, which cannot be compensated solely by the Court™s finding of a violation. Thus, having regard to the nature of the violation found in the present case and deciding  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT38on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 12,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable (see, mutatis mutandis, Ali  and Others v. Turkey, nos. 30226/10 and 4 others, § 249, 28 January 2020).B.Costs and expenses104.  The applicant also claimed EUR 8,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court, including the cost of representation and postal fees. He attached a contract concluded with his lawyer and postal receipts.105.  The Government urged the Court to reject those claims, arguing that the applicant had failed to submit relevant supporting documents. They argued that in any event, the amount claimed in respect of lawyer™s fees was excessive.106.  According to the Court™s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the full sum claimed, covering costs under all heads.C.Default interest107.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points. +++$+++ decision UNANIMOUSLY,1.Declares the application admissible;2.Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;3.Holds(a)that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Turkish Liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:(i)EUR 12,500 (twelve thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;(ii)EUR 8,000 (eight thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses; v.

.  The application concerns the alleged violation of the applicant™s right to respect for his home under Article 8 of the Convention on account of the search of his house, as well as the alleged unfairness of the criminal proceedings on account of the use of allegedly unlawful evidence obtained during that search to convict him. It further pertains to the applicant™s purported inability to examine a certain individual,  under Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention..  The applicant was born in 1985 and is detained in  He was represented by Mr M. Rollas, a lawyer practising in 3.  The Government were represented by their Agent.4.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.I.CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST 5.  On 30 January 2007 a certain  was arrested and questioned by the police in Van, a city in the east of Turkey, on suspicion of being a member BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT2of an illegal organisation. During his interview,  stated that he had met someone named  who had agreed to help him in his work relating to the illegal organisation. Although  had asked him to recruit new members for the illegal organisation, he had not done so.6.  On 31 January 2007 police officers showed  a number of photographs and asked him to identify the people he knew to be connected with the illegal organisation. He identified the applicant from his photograph as  During the photographic identification procedure,  was represented by his lawyer.7.  On 1 February 2007  made statements to the public prosecutor in the presence of his lawyer and confirmed the accuracy of his statements to the police while at the same time submitting that he regretted all his actions within the organisation. Maintaining that he would live an honourable life from then on,  asked to benefit from the provisions of the Criminal Code providing for a reduction in sentence in exchange for information concerning illegal organisations.8.  On 5 February 2008 the Van Assize Court found  guilty of membership of an armed organisation, but reduced his sentence by half pursuant to Article 221 § 4 of the Criminal Code in the light of his repentance and the information he had given regarding the structure and activities of the organisation. The documents submitted by the parties do not indicate whether this judgment became final or not.II.CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE APPLICANT9.  On 7 March 2007 a public passenger bus was set on fire in  by a number of unidentified persons.10.  On 13 March 2007 the  Security Directorate lodged a request with the  public prosecutor™s office and asked for authorisation to intercept and record the telephone conversations of certain individuals, including the applicant, explaining that they had acted on behalf of an illegal organisation, the PKK/KONGRA-GEL (Workers™ Party of Kurdistan/People™s Congress of Kurdistan), recruited new members for it and organised unlawful demonstrations and attacks with Molotov cocktails.11.  On 14 March 2007, at the request of the public prosecutor™s office based on the police report of 13 March 2007, a judge assigned to the  Assize Court, which had special jurisdiction to try a number of aggravated crimes enumerated in Article 250 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in force at the material time (hereinafter referred to as ﬁthe  Specially Authorised Assize Courtﬂ or ﬁtrial courtﬂ), granted authorisation to intercept and record, inter alia, the applicant™s mobile telephone conversations for a period of three months.12.  On 18 March 2007 the  Security Directorate lodged a request with the public prosecutor™s office to carry out searches of the houses of BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT3certain individuals, including the applicant, in the light of intelligence received revealing that those individuals had been planning an attack on 21 March 2007 during the Nevruz celebrations upon the instructions of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL.13.  On 19 March 2007, following a request from the public prosecutor™s office, another judge from the  Specially Authorised Assize Court issued a search warrant in respect of the houses of thirteen individuals, including the house where the applicant was living with his parents. Reproducing the reasons provided in the public prosecutor™s request, the judge stated that the individuals concerned had been acting within the structure of the so-called KKK/TM (Kurdistan Democratic Confederalism) in line with instructions they had received from the senior leadership of the terrorist organisation PKK/KONGRA-GEL and that, according to the intelligence received, they had been aiming to recruit new members from  for the terrorist organisation, carry out unlawful demonstrations and use Molotov cocktails. Searches pursuant to Articles 116 and 117 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were therefore necessary to arrest the suspects with the relevant evidence.14.  At 6.30 a.m. on 20 March 2007 police officers carried out a search of the applicant™s house in the presence of only the applicant™s father. The applicant was not present. The officers found and seized the following documents: (i)  a piece of paper (printout) in the living room with the heading ﬁSürece Ait Rapordurﬂ (ﬁProgress Reportﬂ), which had been drafted by the ﬁApocu Gençlik ﬂ (ﬁYouth Initiative of Apo1ﬂ), and (ii)  forty-three leaflets entitled ﬁBucadaki Yurtsever ﬂ (ﬁTo our Patriotic Tradesmen in Bucaﬂ), also drafted by that initiative, hidden in carpets in the cellar. The documents were neither handwritten nor signed by the applicant. In the first document, the author admitted to having thrown Molotov cocktails at the public passenger bus on 7 March 2007. According to a report drawn up at 7 a.m., the police officers finished the search at 6.50 a.m. At 1.30 p.m. the same day the applicant was taken into custody on suspicion of aiding an illegal organisation.15.  On 21 March 2007, when interviewed by the police, the applicant exercised his right to remain silent in the presence of his lawyer.16.  On 22 March 2007 the applicant gave statements before the judge of the  Specially Authorised Assize Court in the presence of his lawyer and denied the accusations against him, maintaining, in particular, that the documents found at his house did not belong to him. After his questioning, the judge remanded him in custody.17.  On 10 April 2007 the  public prosecutor™s office lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant and twelve other individuals with the 1  Apo is the shortened name of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK, a terrorist organisation.BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT4 Specially Authorised Assize Court, in which the applicant was accused of membership of an illegal organisation and unauthorised possession and use of explosives. He subsequently stood trial before that court.18.  At the first hearing held on 6 August 2007 the applicant gave evidence and denied the accusations. When asked about the search of his house on 20 March 2007, the applicant stated that he had not been present and that the documents found were not his. In his opinion, they had been planted in his house by the police. He further submitted that the police had made his father sign the search report despite the fact that he did not understand Turkish. The documents seized from his house had not been handwritten and had not contained his name, so they could have been drawn up by anybody. When asked about the statements  had made about him, the applicant stated that he did not know anyone of that name and denied that he had a code name or that people called him ﬁTahirﬂ. In his defence submissions, the applicant™s lawyer submitted that the search was null and void as it had been conducted in a manner that was clearly contrary to the law. He further argued that the photographic identification of the applicant by  had not been carried out properly.19.  During the same hearing, three other co-defendants, M.H.A., A.A. and K.R., contested the lawfulness of the searches of their houses and argued that the items found and seized either did not belong to them or had been planted by the police officers. They asked the trial court to hear the individuals who had signed the search-and-seizure reports. At the end of the hearing, the trial court decided to summon three police officers from each search who had drafted the search reports for examination as witnesses and further ordered the collection of the relevant documents from the criminal proceedings against 20.  At the second hearing held on 21 November 2007 another co-defendant,  gave evidence, denied the accusations against him and argued that neither the neighbours nor the district chief (muhtar) had been present during the search of his house. The trial court then heard evidence from six police officers who had taken part in the searches of the defendants™ houses. Among the officers were C.A., L.G. and M.Y., who had carried out the search of the applicant™s house. Police officer C.A. stated that they had carried out the search too early in the morning and that for this reason they had been unable to ensure the presence of two attesting witnesses. They had likewise been unable to reach the district chief (muhtar). Lastly, C.A. submitted that they had only taken notes during the search and had drawn up the actual report at the police station.21.  Police officer L.G. was then heard. He essentially reiterated the same points as C.A. When the applicant™s lawyer asked him about his role during the search and where the documents had been seized from, L.G. stated that he was unwilling to answer those questions and asked the lawyer to refer to BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT5the search report for further information. Reminding him that attesting witnesses had not been present during the search, the applicant™s lawyer asked him whether the applicant™s father had been present during the search of each room. The trial court refused to allow that question to be put to L.G., holding that it was an unnecessary question which could not help shed light on the incident given that he had confirmed that the search report was accurate.22.  Lastly, the trial court heard evidence from M.Y. who, after largely reiterating the same points as C.A. and L.G., submitted that they had found a document inside a notebook in the living room and certain other documents under a carpet in the cellar.23.  On a number of occasions (that is, during the hearings between 21 November 2007 and 2 September 2009) the applicant and his defence lawyers argued that the search of the applicant™s house without the presence of two attesting witnesses as required by Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been unlawful and that the evidence obtained from it had to be considered as such and thus excluded from the case file. At the same time, they also challenged the admission into evidence of the documents found during the search, arguing that they had neither been handwritten by the applicant nor signed by him; they were therefore simple printouts which could have been drawn up by anyone. Furthermore, at a hearing held on 10 March 2008 the applicant™s lawyer asserted that the photograph on the basis of which  had identified the applicant had not been of the latter. The trial court did not provide an answer to any of these defence submissions.24.  At a hearing held on 26 April 2010 the public prosecutor submitted his opinion on the merits of the case, in which he asked the trial court to convict the applicant of membership of a terrorist organisation while at the same time requesting that he be acquitted of causing damage to property in connection with the incident involving the passenger bus.25.  On 10 November 2010 the applicant was found guilty of membership of an illegal organisation and damage to public property by setting fire to a passenger bus on 7 March 2007. He was sentenced to a total of twenty-five years and four months™ imprisonment (twelve years and thirteen years and four months respectively).26.  In its judgment the  Specially Authorised Assize Court noted that during the trial the applicant had challenged the admission into evidence of the documents found in his house and maintained that he did not know  In reaching its conclusion, the trial court relied on the documents found in the applicant™s house and the photographic identification during which  had identified the applicant from a photograph. The trial court considered that the search carried out at the applicant™s house had been ﬁauthorised by a judgeﬂ and had therefore been ﬁin accordance with the procedureﬂ. No mention was made by the court in BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT6its judgment about the applicant™s arguments concerning the lawfulness of the photographic identification procedure.27.  On 11 November 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment.28.  On 14 December 2010 the  public prosecutor also lodged an appeal against the judgment of the trial court, seeking its annulment as regards, inter alia, the applicant™s conviction for damage to public property, arguing that the evidence available had not been capable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that he had either committed that offence or participated in its commission.29.  On 26 December 2011 the public prosecutor of the Court of Cassation submitted his opinion to the Court of Cassation and asked for the trial court™s judgment to be upheld.30.  On 5 March 2012 the applicant™s lawyer responded to the public prosecutor™s opinion. He maintained that the judgment had been rendered without  having been heard as a witness or having identified the applicant before the first-instance court. He further maintained that the identification carried out by the police had been contrary to supplementary section 6 of the Powers and Duties of the Police Act (Law no. 2559). He argued that the identification should have been carried out by showing photographs of different people together to the identifier and reminding him that the photograph of the accused might not be among the photographs shown. The lawyer also maintained that the search carried out at the applicant™s house had been unlawful because neither two members of the community council nor any neighbours had been present during the search, contrary to the requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure.31.  The applicant™s lawyer also maintained that the documents found at the house had not belonged to the applicant; according to his client, they had been planted there by the police. The lawyer further submitted that the documents found had not contained the applicant™s fingerprints and had been nameless. He also maintained that there was no evidence that the applicant had set a public passenger bus on fire and that the judgment of the first-instance court had not been adequately reasoned to explain why the applicant had been found guilty of that offence.32.  On 17 April 2012 the Court of Cassation upheld the trial court™s judgment without mentioning any of the arguments raised by the applicant.RELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND PRACTICEI.CONSTITUTION33.  Article 38 § 6 of the Constitution provides, in so far as relevant, as follows:ﬁ...BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT7(6) Unlawfully obtained things or items (bulgu) [which have not yet been classed as evidence] shall not be admitted as evidence....ﬂII.CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE34.

However, identification cannot be done by only showing a single photograph of the suspect or different photographs of him or her. The photographs of the different persons must also be the same size.ﬂIV.CASE-LAW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT36.  On 19 November 2014, in the case of   (application no. 2013/6183), the Constitutional Court was called upon to examine whether the applicant™s right to a fair trial had been breached on account of an unlawful house search due to the absence of two attesting witnesses as required by Article 97 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure and the use by the domestic courts of evidence obtained from it in the context of compensation proceedings initiated against him as a result of his unauthorised possession of pelt, trophies and animal horns. The Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant™s right to a fair trial, holding that the domestic courts™ decisions against him had been based to a decisive extent on the evidence that had been obtained from a house search carried out in an unlawful manner owing to the absence of two attesting witnesses.37.  In its judgment dated 1 February 2018 in the case of Orhan  (application no. 2014/4704), the plenary Constitutional Court examined whether the applicant™s right to a fair trial had been breached on account of the search carried out by police officers in the absence of a judicial warrant or a written order by the public prosecutor at the house of two individuals connected with the applicant. In answering this question in the positive, the Constitutional Court first held that the illicit drugs and the precision scales obtained from the search had been decisive evidence in respect of the applicant™s conviction for drug trafficking. It then emphasised that the trial court had not carried out any assessment as regards the applicant™s allegations and objections concerning the manner in which the search had been conducted. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court concluded that the ﬁunlawfulnessﬂ in the manner the search had been conducted was such as to undermine the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against the applicant.BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT9THE LAWI.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION38.  The applicant complained that the search of his house had lacked a legal basis owing to the absence of two attesting witnesses, as required by Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He relied on Article8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:ﬁ1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.ﬂA. Admissibility39.  The Government raised a preliminary objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, arguing that the applicant had failed to avail himself of the remedy laid down in Article 141 § 1 (i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides for the possibility of bringing a claim for compensation if the search has been carried out in a disproportionate manner (ölçüsüz bir ).40.  The applicant argued that in order for a claim for compensation to be brought under Article 141 § 1 (i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a court decision was required finding the search illegal or declaring that it had been carried out in a disproportionate manner. As there had been no such decision in his case, the remedy suggested by the Government could not be used by him.41.  The Court reiterates that the purpose of the rule on the exhaustion of domestic remedies is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to it (see G.I.E.M. S.R.L. and Others v. Italy [GC], nos. 1828/06 and 2 others, § 176, 28 June 2018).42.  The obligation under Article 35 requires only that an applicant should have normal recourse to the remedies likely to be effective, adequate and accessible (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 45, ECHR 2006-II). In particular, the only remedies which the Convention requires an applicant to make normal use of are those that relate to the breaches alleged and are at the same time available and sufficient (see Sérvulo & Associados - Sociedade de Advogados, RL and Others v. Portugal, no. 27013/10, § 68, 3 September 2015). The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see  and Others BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT10v. Serbia (preliminary objection) [GC], nos. 17153/11 and 29 others, § 77, 25 March 2014, and Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 66, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV).43.  Moreover, it is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant™s complaint and offered reasonable prospects of success (see , cited above, § 77, and Sher and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 5201/11, § 132, ECHR 2015 (extracts)). Once this burden has been satisfied, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from this requirement.44.  Turning back to the circumstances of the case, the Court notes that Article 141 § 1 (i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is capable of providing monetary compensation in respect of complaints regarding the disproportionate manner in which searches of premises have been conducted, a fact also demonstrated by the wording of that provision. In that connection, the Court reiterates that it has already examined a similar issue in Aksoy v. Turkey ((dec.) [Committee], no. 47585/16, 5 March 2019) and found, in line with the Constitutional Court™s judgment in that case, that the applicant (a lawyer) should have availed himself of the remedy provided for under Article 141 § 1 (i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in respect of his complaints relating, inter alia, to the improper seizure of documents belonging to his clients during the search of his office (compare Maslák and Michálková v. the Czech Republic, no. 52028/13, § 45 in fine, 14 January 2016).45.  That being the case, the Court is called upon to assess whether the applicant™s complaints under Article 8 of the Convention concern the allegedly disproportionate manner in which the search of his house was carried out and hence may fall within the ambit of Article 141 § 1 (i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.46.  In that connection, the Court observes that unlike the applicant in the above-mentioned case of Aksoy, the applicant in the present case did not raise any complaints which may arguably be interpreted as relating to the disproportionate or excessive nature of the search of his house. On the contrary, his complaint was that the search had lacked a legal basis and had thus been unlawful owing to the absence of two attesting witnesses, whose presence was a statutory requirement under Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see Avanesyan v. Russia, no. 41152/06, § 31, 18 September 2014, and compare Xavier Da Silveira v. France, no. 43757/05, § 46, 21 January 2010). Significantly, the Government did not provide the Court with any examples of domestic case-law where the BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT11domestic courts had examined a claim relating to the lawfulness of a search under Article 141 § 1 (i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and awarded the claimants compensation in the event that they found the search unlawful (see Brazzi v. Italy, no. 57278/11, § 49, 27 September 2018, and Gutsanovi v. Bulgaria, no. 34529/10, §§ 210-211, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).47.  Having regard to the nature of the applicant™s complaints and the Government™s failure to demonstrate that a compensation claim under Article 141 § 1 (i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is capable of providing redress in respect of complaints regarding the legality of searches, the Court is unable to conclude that the Government discharged the burden of proving that this remedy was effective for the applicant™s complaint concerning the unlawfulness of the search of his house. It therefore follows that the applicant was not required to avail himself of the remedy provided for under Article 141 § 1 (i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the Government™s preliminary objection must be dismissed.48.  The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1.  The parties™ submissions(a)  The applicant49.  The applicant asserted that the police had blatantly disregarded the statutory requirement to have two witnesses present during the search of his house. In that connection, he argued that although the police officers had submitted before the trial court that they could not find anyone, including the district chief, to take part in the search given that it had taken place at dawn, the search report had not indicated any such information. It was therefore clear that the police officers had not made any effort to comply with the requirement. In support of his contention, the applicant submitted four different search-and-seizure reports where searches had been performed early in the morning and in the presence of two witnesses pursuant to Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.(b)  The Government50.  The Government maintained that the search of the applicant™s house had been conducted with a view to obtaining evidence concerning his activities in a terrorist organisation, namely the PKK. Moreover, the search warrant had been issued by the  Specially Authorised Assize Court, which had clearly defined the location and date of the search without using any vague wording. The Government stressed the importance of this last BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT12point, as the warrant had not given a broad scope of authority to the police officers. Moreover, the applicant™s father had been present during the search. Consequently, the Government submitted that the search in question had had a basis in domestic law.2.  The Court™s assessment51.  The Court notes at the outset that the notion of ﬁhomeﬂ in Article 8 § 1 of the Convention encompasses a private individual™s home (see Kolesnichenko v. Russia, no. 19856/04, § 29, 9 April 2009, and Buck v. Germany, no. 41604/98, § 31, ECHR 2005-IV). In the instant case, it is not disputed between the parties that the search of the applicant™s house by police officers on 20 March 2007 constituted an interference with his right to respect for his home, protected under Article 8 of the Convention (see Kilyen v. Romania, no. 44817/04, § 31, 25 February 2014, and Kaletsch v. Germany (dec.), no. 31890/06, 23 June 2009). Such interference is not justified under Article 8 unless it is in accordance with the law, pursues at least one of the legitimate aims enumerated in the second paragraph of that provision and is necessary in a democratic society (see DELTA PEKÁRNY a.s. v. the Czech Republic, no. 97/11, § 79, 2 October 2014).52.  Therefore, the Court should ascertain whether the interference complained of was ﬁin accordance with the lawﬂ within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention.53.  The expression ﬁin accordance with the lawﬂ requires, firstly, that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law and be compatible with the rule of law. Secondly, it refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him, and compatible with the rule of law (see, among other authorities, Camenzind v. Switzerland, 16 December 1997, § 37, Reports 1997-VIII). The phrase thus implies, inter alia, that domestic law must be sufficiently foreseeable in its terms to give individuals an adequate indication as to the circumstances in which and conditions on which the authorities are entitled to resort to measures affecting their rights under the Convention (see Fernández Martínez v. Spain [GC], no. 56030/07, § 117, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).54.  According to the Court™s settled case-law, the phrase ﬁin accordance with the lawﬂ requires, at a minimum, compliance with domestic law (see Peev v. Bulgaria, no. 64209/01, § 43, 26 July 2007). Even if it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply the relevant domestic law (see Kruslin v. France, 24 April 1990, § 29, Series A no. 176-A, and Amann v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27798/95, § 52, ECHR 2000-II), the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether domestic law has been complied with (see Craxi v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25337/94, § 78, 17 July 2003).55.  Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court notes that BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT13while the search was conducted pursuant to a judicial warrant issued under Articles 116 and 117 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it was the applicant™s contention that the search of his house had been unlawful in terms of domestic law in that it had been conducted in the absence of two attesting witnesses, the presence of whom was mandatory under Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.56.  The Court observes that under Turkish criminal procedural law, the presence of two attesting witnesses is a legal requirement for the domestic authorities to be able to conduct a search at private residences, business premises and any other enclosed places without the participation of a public prosecutor (Article 119 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, see paragraph 34 above). This point thus concerns the legality of a search and falls to be examined under the question of whether the search was in accordance with the law (see, Özgün Öztunç v. Turkey, no. 5839/09, §§ 37-40, 27 March 2018, and compare Dragan  v. Serbia, no. 75229/10, §§ 74 and 77, 14 April 2020).57.  The Court has already held, inter alia, that non-compliance with statutory requirements owing to the absence of witnesses whose presence was mandatory under the legal provisions of a given Contracting State could give rise to the conclusion that the search was conducted in a manner not in accordance with the law and therefore unlawful (see Alexov v. Bulgaria, no. 54578/00, §§ 128-130, 22 May 2008). The Court observes that by putting in place a legal framework and requiring the relevant authorities, notably the police, to meticulously observe the requirement to have two attesting witnesses present for searches of private residences carried out in the absence of a public prosecutor as an element of lawfulness, Turkish law provides a particularly important procedural safeguard capable of offering individuals adequate and sufficient guarantees against abuse or arbitrary interference by the public authorities with their rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention.58.  In the instant case, the Court notes that the police officers who conducted the search were examined by the trial court in their capacity as witnesses. They acknowledged that they had carried out the search without ensuring the presence of two other persons, as was required by Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Government, for their part, did not dispute that fact either, but reiterated the statements the police officers who had conducted the search had made in their capacity as witnesses before the trial court. According to them, two attesting witnesses had not been present during the search, allegedly because it had been conducted at daybreak. In the Government™s view, as the search had concerned a terrorist offence, nobody in the vicinity of the house had agreed to take part in it.59.  Be that as it may, the fact remains that none of those points was indicated in the search report, which was also drawn up by those officers. Nor was there any other evidence capable of demonstrating that the officers BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT14actually took any steps to ensure the presence of two attesting witnesses. More importantly, the domestic courts did not even outline those points in their decisions, let alone assess them (see Bože v. Latvia, no. 40927/05, § 82 in fine, 18 May 2017). In any event, none of these grounds had any basis in the statutory provisions concerning searches. In fact, it appears that the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure and the relevant provisions do not provide any exceptions for non-compliance with the crucial safeguard set out in Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in so far as searches of private residences are concerned (see Aydemir v. Turkey, no. 17811/04, § 99, 24 May 2011, and compare Kobiashvili v. Georgia, no. 36416/06, §§ 62-64, 14 March 2019).60.  That being the case, the Court is unable to conclude that the search of the applicant™s house was carried out in accordance with the law.61.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.II.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 §§ 1 AND 3 (D) OF THE CONVENTION62.  The applicant complained under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that he had not had a fair trial on account of the trial court™s use of unlawful and unreliable evidence allegedly found during the unlawful search of his house to sentence him to more than twenty-five years™ imprisonment. Relying on Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention, he further complained that the trial court had used the unlawful evidence given by  in his statements and the photographic identification procedure without examining him as a witness and clarifying the discrepancies in his statements. Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention reads, in so far as relevant, as follows:ﬁ1.  In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...ﬂ... ... ...3.  Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:(d)  to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him.ﬂA. Admissibility63.  The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible.BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT15B. Merits1.  The parties™ submissions(a)  The applicant64.  The applicant argued that he had not had a fair trial in that he had been convicted on the basis of unlawful evidence obtained from an unlawful search. In that connection, he submitted that the search of his house had been carried out in a manner that had clearly disregarded the relevant statutory provisions since it had not been conducted in the presence of two attesting witnesses, as required by Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. That fact had been indirectly confirmed by the Government, who had tried to downplay an unlawful practice by referring to it as a ﬁprocedural deficiencyﬂ. In the applicant™s view, the absence of two attesting witnesses during the search of his house had had the effect of preventing an effective judicial review of the legality of the search and the question of whether the documents had already been in the house prior to their seizure or had been planted there by the police.65.  Furthermore, when the police officers had testified as witnesses during the trial, the applicant had attempted to ask them whether his father had been present during the search of each room, but the trial court had not allowed that question, finding it of absolutely no relevance. The applicant thus rejected the Government™s argument that his father™s presence was sufficient to remedy the prejudice stemming from the unlawfulness of the search.66.  Lastly, the applicant furnished the Court with different reports of searches which had been carried out early in the morning in  within the context of different investigations into terrorist offences, where the police had been able to secure the presence of attesting witnesses. In the applicant™s view, these were sufficient to rebut the Government™s reliance on the police officers™ submissions that they had been unable to find an attesting witness because it had been too early in the morning and the case had concerned a terrorist offence. In any event, none of that information had been duly recorded by the police officers in the search report. In view of the above, the applicant invited the Court to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention.(b)  The Government67.  At the outset, the Government submitted that the search of the applicant™s house had been carried out pursuant to a judicial warrant and that the applicant™s father had been present during the search. Moreover, at the applicant™s request, the trial court had heard the police officers who had conducted the search with a view to remedying the procedural deficiency BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT16stemming from the absence of two attesting witnesses. Both the applicant and his lawyer had been able to put questions to the police officers, who had stated that they had been unable to have two attesting witnesses present because the search had taken place early in the morning. In the Government™s view, it had been natural for people not to have wanted to participate in the search of a house given that a terrorist offence had been at issue. Accordingly, the Government argued that the trial court had not considered that the evidence had lacked the procedural requirements and invited the Court to hold that Article 6 of the Convention had not been violated in the instant case.2.  The Court™s assessment(a)  The general principles68.  It is not for the Court to deal with alleged errors of law or fact committed by the national courts unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, for instance where, in exceptional cases, such errors may be said to constitute ﬁunfairnessﬂ incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention (see Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, § 83, 11 July 2017).69.  The Court reiterates that, while Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, § 45, Series A no. 140; Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, 9 June 1998, § 34, Reports 1998IV; Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, §§ 94-96, ECHR 2006-IX; and Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2), cited above, § 83).70.  It is therefore not the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence Œ for example, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law Œ may be admissible or, indeed, whether the applicant was guilty or not. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the ﬁunlawfulnessﬂ in question and, where a violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, § 89, 10 March 2009; Lee Davies v. Belgium, no. 18704/05, § 41, 28 July 2009; and Prade v. Germany, no. 7215/10, § 33, 3 March 2016).71.  In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had to whether the rights of the defence were respected. It must be established, in particular, whether the applicant was given the opportunity of challenging the authenticity of the evidence and of opposing its use (see Szilagyi v. Romania (dec.), no. 30164/04, 17 December 2013). In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT17including whether the circumstances in which it was obtained cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy (see, among other authorities, Bykov, cited above, § 90, and Lisica v. Croatia, no. 20100/06, § 49, 25 February 2010). While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see Lee Davies, cited above, § 42; Bykov, cited above, § 90; and  v. Croatia, no. 22251/13, § 48, 25 October 2016).72.  The Court also reiterates that, according to its established case-law reflecting a principle linked to the proper administration of justice, judgments of courts and tribunals should adequately state the reasons on which they are based (see Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2), cited above, § 84). The extent to which this duty to give reasons applies may vary according to the nature of the decision and must be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see García Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, § 26, ECHR 1999-I). Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument advanced by the complainant, this obligation presupposes that parties to judicial proceedings can expect to receive a specific and explicit reply to the arguments which are decisive for the outcome of those proceedings (see, among other authorities, Ruiz Torija v. Spain, 9 December 1994, §§ 29-30, Series A no. 303-A, and Higgins and Others v. France, 19 February 1998, §§ 42-43, Reports 1998-I). Moreover, in cases relating to interference with rights secured under the Convention, the Court seeks to establish whether the reasons provided for decisions given by the domestic courts are automatic or stereotypical (see, mutatis mutandis, Paradiso and Campanelli v. Italy [GC], no. 25358/12, § 210, ECHR 2017).73.  In view of the principle that the Convention is intended to guarantee not rights that are theoretical or illusory but rights that are practical and effective, the right to a fair trial cannot be seen as effective unless the requests and observations of the parties are truly ﬁheardﬂ, that is to say, properly examined by the tribunal (see Ilgar Mammadov v. Azerbaijan (no. 2), no. 919/15, § 206, 16 November 2017; Carmel Saliba v. Malta, no. 24221/13, § 65, 29 November 2016 with further references therein; and Fodor v. Romania, no. 45266/07, § 28, 16 September 2014). In examining the fairness of criminal proceedings, the Court has also held in particular that by ignoring a specific, pertinent and important point made by the accused, the domestic courts fall short of their obligations under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Zhang v. Ukraine, no. 6970/15, § 61, 13 November 2018, and Nechiporuk and Yonkalo v. Ukraine, no. 42310/04, § 280, 21 April 2011).(b)  Application of those principles to the present case74.  The Court notes at the outset that the trial court convicted the BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT18applicant of membership of a terrorist organisation and causing damage to public property for mounting an attack on a public passenger bus with Molotov cocktails and accordingly sentenced him to a total of twenty-five years and four months™ imprisonment. As regards the offence of membership of a terrorist organisation, the trial court relied on two pieces of evidence: (i)  the statements  had made in the context of a separate set of criminal proceedings and his identification of the applicant from a photograph, and (ii)  the documents found and seized during the search of the applicant™s house.75.  As to the incident relating to the public passenger bus, the trial court indicated in its reasoned judgment that the sole evidence relating thereto was the document entitled ﬁSürece Ait Rapordurﬂ (ﬁProgress Reportﬂ) found during the search of the applicant™s house on 20 March 2007, in which the author had admitted to having thrown a Molotov cocktail at the bus. As a result, it is safe to conclude that the evidence found during the search and the evidence given by  played a central role in the applicant™s conviction (compare Tsion v. Georgia (dec.), no. 7720/12, 16 June 2020).76.  As regards the search of the applicant™s house, the Court notes that the applicant denied that the documents found were his, arguing that they might have been planted by the police, who had failed to conduct the search in the presence of two attesting witnesses despite this being mandatory under Article 119 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On that basis, the applicant argued that a judicial review of the crucial question of whether the police had planted the evidence in his house had effectively become impossible owing to non-compliance with the above-mentioned statutory provision.77.  The Court reiterates that it has already found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention on the grounds that the search of the applicant™s house was not carried out in the manner which was not in accordance with the law since it was conducted in the absence of two attesting witnesses.78.  The Court™s case-law under Article 6 of the Convention does not automatically exclude the use of evidence by the domestic courts which may be considered ﬁunlawfulﬂ under the domestic legal provisions (see, among other authorities, Parris v. Cyprus (dec.), no. 56354/00, 4 July 2002). However, in cases where the defence is able to lay the basis of an arguable claim capable of calling into question the reliability or authenticity of a piece of evidence, regardless of whether it was ﬁunlawfulﬂ or not in terms of domestic law, the Court™s case-law under Article 6 of the Convention requires the domestic courts to conduct a thorough assessment, in an adversarial manner, of all the circumstances of the case with a view to allaying any doubts as to the authenticity of evidence (see Murtazaliyeva v. Russia [GC], no. 36658/05, § 157, 18 December 2018; Bykov, cited above, § 95; and  v. Croatia, no. 36044/09, § 82, 17 October 2013).BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT1979.  Furthermore, the Court notes that both the Constitution of Turkey and the Code of Criminal Procedure provide very strong procedural safeguards vis-à-vis unlawfully obtained evidence by establishing a firm stance against the admissibility and use of such evidence in criminal proceedings. First and foremost, Article 38 § 6 of the Constitution indicates that unlawfully obtained things or items (bulgu) (which have not yet been classed as evidence) cannot be admitted as evidence. Similarly, Article 206 § 2 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that evidence obtained unlawfully is not admissible. Article 217 § 2 of the same Code stipulates that an offence may be proven by all kinds of lawfully obtained evidence. Article 230 § 1 (b) of the Code places the trial court under a duty to specify the evidence upon which it has decided to rely and explicitly and separately indicate the evidence obtained unlawfully. In that connection, the Court further notes that the Constitutional Court has also adopted a similar approach in respect of the use by the domestic courts of evidence obtained from searches deemed to be contrary to the relevant statutory provisions (see paragraphs 36 and 37).80.  Against this background, the Court considers that the absence of an appropriate response from the domestic courts vis-à-vis a substantiated claim that a certain piece of evidence has been obtained in breach of statutory requirements or the rights and freedoms protected by the Convention and the Protocols thereto would, in principle, be incompatible with the requirements of a fair trial, including, in particular, where the evidence was of decisive importance for the conviction.81.  In the present case, the Court™s role is to ascertain, in the light of its above-mentioned case-law, (i)  whether the applicant was able to put forward a prima facie case against the lawfulness, authenticity, veracity and admissibility of the evidence found during the search of his house, and (ii)  whether the domestic courts carried out a thorough examination on those points in the manner described above (see, mutatis mutandis, Mehmet Zeki Çelebi v. Turkey, no. 27582/07, § 51, 28 January 2020). Evidently, the yardstick against which the nature and scope of such scrutiny is to be measured will be determined in accordance with the importance of the evidence in question; the more important the role of the evidence for an applicant™s conviction, the more rigorous the domestic courts™ scrutiny should be (see, mutatis mutandis, Murtazaliyeva, § 166 for a similar approach in respect of the domestic courts™ duty vis-à-vis the defence™s requests to examine a witness, and Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, § 116, ECHR 2011 for a similar approach in respect of the procedural safeguards vis-à-vis the evidence given by absent witnesses).82.  The Court considers that the first part of the above question must be answered in the affirmative, particularly given that the applicant and his co-defendants either themselves or through their lawyers used on several BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT20occasions their legal possibility to draw the domestic courts™ attention to the fact that, in their view, the searches had not been conducted in accordance with the requirements of domestic law.83.  That being so, the Court must further assess whether the domestic courts carried out a thorough examination of the lawfulness of the search of the applicant™s house as well as the admissibility, reliability and quality of the evidence found and seized. Given the central role of the documents discovered during the search for the applicant™s conviction, the Court considers that it was imperative for the trial court to subject these issues to the most searching scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Bosak and Others v. Croatia, nos. 40429/14 and 3 others, § 80, 6 June 2019). Moreover, as the documents contained no elements which might reasonably have led an objective observer to conclude that they had been drawn up by the applicant, the Court notes that the national courts were under a duty to exhaust every reasonable possibility of finding out exactly whether the author of that document, who had confessed to attacking the public passenger bus, was the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Kasparov and Others v. Russia, no. 21613/07, § 64, 3 October 2013). In any event, the need to carry out those examinations as to the lawfulness of the search and the evidence obtained from it was incumbent on the trial court under the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure.84.  In that connection, the Court observes that the trial court heard evidence from three police officers and that two of them admitted that the search had indeed been carried out in the absence of two attesting witnesses because it had taken place in the early hours of 20 March 2007. Moreover, when the applicant™s lawyer wanted to ask one of the officers whether the applicant™s father had been present when each room had been searched, the trial court rejected that question, finding it of absolutely no relevance in ascertaining the truth, without giving any reasons for that conclusion. In the Court™s view, this question was all the more pertinent given that it might have shed light on the applicant™s allegation that the police officers had planted the relevant documents in his house. In the same vein, the trial court appears to have made no assessment of the applicant™s submission that the fact that his father had signed the search report did not mean much due to the fact that he did not speak Turkish (compare Kirakosyan v. Armenia (no. 2), no. 24723/05, § 62, 4 February 2016).85.  Similarly, the trial court also failed to take any steps to examine the link between the applicant and the document discovered during the search of his house, a one-page printout, which contained neither his fingerprints nor his signature (see, mutatis mutandis, Layijov v. Azerbaijan, no. 22062/07, § 73, 10 April 2014).86.  It is striking to note that the trial court™s reasoned judgment made no mention of the evidence given by the two police officers who had admitted their failure to fulfil the statutory requirement under Article 119 § 4 of the BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT21Code of Criminal Procedure, that is to say the presence of two attesting witnesses (contrast Erduran and Em Export  Tic.  v. Turkey, nos. 25707/05 and 28614/06, § 110, 20 November 2018). The trial court merely held that the search had been ﬁauthorised by a judgeﬂ and had therefore been ﬁin accordance with the procedureﬂ without in any way assessing the relevance of the police officers™ statements (see, mutatis mutandis, Carmel Saliba v. Malta, cited above, § 70). Such scant and stereotypical reasoning means that the trial court failed to demonstrate that it had duly examined and effectively answered the applicant™s specific, pertinent and important objections against the lawfulness of the search as well as the admissibility, authenticity and veracity of the main piece of evidence obtained from it before imposing an extremely severe custodial sentence on him.87.  More importantly, the trial court failed to fulfil its duty to apply the relevant procedural safeguards enshrined in the Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure regarding the unlawfulness of evidence, which would have led it to rule on the admissibility of the contested evidence. In the Court™s view, that procedural shortcoming had a particular bearing on the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, in view of the weight attached, under Article 53 of the Convention, to the non-application by the domestic courts of the enhanced protection afforded to the applicant by the domestic legal provisions, including the Constitution, regarding the admissibility and lawfulness of the main piece of evidence.88.  In view of the above, the Court cannot conclude that the applicant™s defence submissions going to the heart of the lawfulness, admissibility, authenticity and veracity of the main piece of evidence received an appropriate response from the domestic courts, which appear to have sidestepped the effective procedural safeguards by failing to provide reasons capable of showing that they had duly considered them.89.  In sum, the use of the main piece of evidence found during the search of the applicant™s house without applying the necessary procedural safeguards rendered the criminal proceedings against him unfair (see Botea v. Romania, no. 40872/04, §§ 42-43, 10 December 2013, and contrast Musa  v. Turkey, no. 63315/00, §§ 92 and 95, 5 January 2010).90.  Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.91.  That being the case, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine the merits of the applicant™s complaint under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention regarding his alleged inability to examine  before the trial court.BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT22III.APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION92.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:ﬁIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.ﬂA.Damage93.  The applicant claimed 100,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage, arguing that because he had been deprived of his liberty since 20 March 2007, he had been unable to provide for his family of nine. As to non-pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed EUR 100,000 corresponding to the pain and suffering he had had to endure as a result of having been sentenced to more than twenty-five years™ imprisonment.94.  The Government contested those claims, arguing that (i)  there was no causal link between the claims and the alleged violations of the Convention and (ii)  that the claims were in any event excessive and did not correspond to the amounts awarded in the Court™s case-law.95.  The Court notes that the applicant failed to substantiate his pecuniary damage claims; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards the applicant EUR 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, in the light of the two different violations it has found in the instant case (see Cevat Özel v. Turkey, no. 19602/06, § 42, 7 June 2016, and  v. Turkey, no. 30083/10, § 136, 7 June 2016). Notwithstanding that conclusion, the Court reiterates that the most appropriate form of redress would be a retrial in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, should the applicant so request (see Soytemiz v. Turkey, no. 57837/09, §§ 63-64, 27 November 2018).B.Costs and expenses96.  The applicant also claimed EUR 3,000 for legal fees and a further EUR 229 for postage and translation costs incurred before the Court. In support of those claims, he submitted postal receipts and an invoice regarding the translation expenses.97.  The Government invited the Court to reject, pursuant to Rule 60 §§ 1 and 3 of the Rules of Court, the applicant™s claims under this head, with the exception of the translation expenses.98.  According to the Court™s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for legal fees BUDAK v. TURKEY JUDGMENT23given the absence of any documents to support it. On the other hand, it considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 229 for postal and translation expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Court, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant.C.Default interest99.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points. +++$+++ decision UNANIMOUSLY,1.Declares the application admissible;2.Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;3.Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;4.Holds that there is no need to examine the complaint under Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention;5.Holds,(a)that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:(i) EUR 10,000 (ten thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;(ii) EUR 229 (two hundred and twenty-nine euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;(b)that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;6.

.  The issues in this case are whether the length of civil proceedings which lasted from 2012 until 2020 was compatible with the ﬁreasonable timeﬂ requirement, laid down in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, and whether the applicant had an effective domestic remedy for his length-of-proceedings complaint, as required by Article 13 of the Convention..  The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in  The applicant was represented by Mr H.  a lawyer practising in ”ivinice.3.  The Government were represented by Mr M.  Minister of Human Rights and Refugees of Bosnia and Herzegovina.4.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.5.  On 22 February 2007 K.S. and R.S., a married couple, were convicted of forgery causing a loss to the applicant in the amount of 1,080 convertible marks (BAM)1. Their conviction became final on 19 October 2007.1 The convertible mark uses the same fixed exchange rate to the euro that the German mark  v. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA JUDGMENT26.  On 23 October 2012 the applicant brought an action for damages against the couple mentioned above and a microcredit organisation involved in this case. He claimed BAM 1,080 plus default interest and costs.7.  It took almost seven years to decide a preliminary question Œ whether R.S. had properly filed a defence to the applicant™s claim. That question was finally decided on 30 August 2019. The  Municipal Court then held two hearings in the absence of K.S. and R.S. (11 September and 7 October 2019) and delivered a judgment on 7 November 2019. It upheld the claim against K.S. and R.S. As regards the third defendant, it ruled that the statute of limitations had expired.8.  While the case was still pending before the  Municipal Court, on 15 January 2018 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal complaining about the length of those proceedings. The Constitutional Court rejected his constitutional appeal on 6 November 2018 (see paragraph 11 below).9.  On 27 January 2020 the Tuzla Cantonal Court upheld the judgment of the  Municipal Court of 7 November 2019 (see paragraph 7 above).RELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND PRACTICE10.  In a pilot decision rendered on 10 May 2017 the Constitutional Court held that the excessive length of proceedings was a systemic problem, found a breach of Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights and indicated general measures, including the introduction of a preventive remedy for the length of pending proceedings.11.  Having established that the general measures indicated in the pilot decision (see paragraph 10 above) had not yet been fully implemented, the Constitutional Court decided, on 6 November 2018, to no longer deal with the issue of the length of pending (as opposed to terminated) proceedings. It also rejected the applicant™s and all other constitutional appeals raising that issue as being substantially the same as a matter that had already been examined by the Constitutional Court. It has since delivered a number of similar decisions rejecting, on the same grounds, hundreds of constitutional appeals raising the issue of the length of pending proceedings.12.  At the same time, the Constitutional Court has continued to deal with the issue of the length of finished proceedings (see, among others, decisions nos. AP 3979/18 of 11 March 2020 and AP 5000/18 of 6 May 2020).has (1 convertible mark = 0.51129 euros). v. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA JUDGMENT3THE LAWI.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION13.  The applicant complained that the length of the civil proceedings in his case had been incompatible with the ﬁreasonable timeﬂ requirement laid down in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:ﬁIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...ﬂ14.  The period to be taken into consideration began on 23 October 2012, when the applicant brought his claim against K.S., R.S. and a microcredit organisation (see paragraph 6 above) and ended on 27 January 2020, when the Tuzla Cantonal Court delivered its final judgment (see paragraph 9 above). It thus lasted more than seven years at two levels of jurisdiction.A.Admissibility15.  The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible.B.Merits16.  The applicant submitted that his civil case was simple. Furthermore, since he and his family (unemployed wife and two minor children) lived on his monthly disability pension of BAM 765, he added that the case was important for him.17.  The Government argued that the case at issue did not fall into any of the categories of cases which called for particular expedition (such as cases concerning civil status and capacity, employment disputes and child custody cases). They also argued that the infirmity of one of the defendants (K.S.) had slowed down the examination of the case to a certain extent.18.  The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, § 43, ECHR 2000-VII).19.  Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of justifying the length of the civil proceedings in the instant case. In particular, the Court observes that it took the domestic courts almost seven  v. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA JUDGMENT4years to decide a simple preliminary question (see paragraph 7 above). After that question had been decided, the civil proceedings lasted less than five months at two levels of jurisdiction (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above). This shows that the case was indeed not complex, as pointed out by the applicant (see paragraph 16 above). Furthermore, the Court rejects the Government™s claim that the infirmity of K.S. justified the length of the civil proceedings at issue (see paragraph 17 above), since the domestic courts found that his presence was not mandatory (see paragraph 7 above).20.  Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the ﬁreasonable timeﬂ requirement.21.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.II.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION22.  The applicant complained of the lack of an effective domestic remedy for his length-of-proceedings complaint. He relied in that regard on Article 13 of the Convention, which reads as follows:ﬁEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.ﬂA.Admissibility23.  The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible.B.Merits24.  The applicant argued that a constitutional appeal was clearly not an effective remedy for the length of pending proceedings and that no other remedy was available.25.  The Government maintained that the Constitutional Court™s decision in the present case, although formally rejecting the applicant™s appeal (see paragraph 11 above), had actually accelerated the proceedings under consideration. The applicant had thus had an effective domestic remedy at his disposal.26.  The Court reiterates that Article 13 guarantees an effective remedy before a national authority for an alleged breach of the requirement under Article 6 § 1 to hear a case within a reasonable time (see  v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 156, ECHR 2000-XI). v. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA JUDGMENT527.  It must be emphasised at the outset that the present case does not call into doubt the effectiveness of a constitutional appeal for complaints about the length of finished proceedings (see paragraph 12 above). The only issue in the instant case is whether the applicant had any effective domestic remedy at his disposal for his complaint about the length of pending proceedings when he lodged his application with the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, § 17, ECHR 2002-VIII). In this respect, the Court observes that the present application was lodged on 6 December 2018, when the applicant™s civil case was still pending at first instance (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above).28.  In this connection, the Court observes that on 6 November 2018 the Constitutional Court decided to no longer deal with the issue of the length of pending proceedings and rejected the applicant™s appeal raising that issue (see paragraph 11 above). Even assuming that the applicant™s constitutional appeal nevertheless accelerated the civil proceedings under consideration, as submitted by the Government (see paragraph 25 above), this would not be sufficient in itself to render that remedy ﬁeffectiveﬂ within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention. Indeed, the Court has held that if an acceleratory remedy is used to speed up proceedings which have already lasted too long, it will not be considered effective unless accompanied by a compensatory remedy (see, for example, Mirjana  v. Croatia, no. 9849/15, § 72, 30 July 2020, and the decisions cited therein). It has not been alleged by the Government that the applicant had any compensatory remedy at his disposal at the relevant time.29.  There has therefore been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.III.APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION30.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:ﬁIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.ﬂA.Damage31.  The applicant claimed 6,500 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.32.  The Government considered the amount claimed to be excessive.33.  Deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,800 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable. v. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA JUDGMENT6B.Costs and expenses34.  The applicant claimed EUR 246 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Constitutional Court and EUR 1,100 for those incurred before the Court. He submitted a bill of costs, based on the tariff fixed by the local bar association.35.  The Government contested the claim as unsubstantiated.36.  According to the Court™s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these were actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum (see, for example, Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, § 54, ECHR 2000XI). In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sums claimed, totalling EUR 1,346, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant (see, by analogy,  v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 27966/06, § 70, 6 November 2007).C.Default interest37.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points. +++$+++ decision UNANIMOUSLY,1.Declares the application admissible;2.Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;3.Holds that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention;4.Holds(a)that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:(i) EUR 1,800 (one thousand eight hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;(ii) EUR 1,346 (one thousand three hundred and forty-six euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses; v.

.  The case concerns disciplinary proceedings against the applicant, who was a judicial officer1, mainly on account of certain statements he had made on various occasions..  The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Ankara. He was represented by Ms P. Akgül  lawyer.3.  The Government were represented by their Agent.4.  The facts, as submitted by the parties, can be summarised as follows.I.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASEA.The applicant™s career5.  On 23 November 1989 the applicant began his career in the national judicial service. On 1 July 1998 he was appointed to the post of prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. In June 2011 he was appointed as judge in Istanbul. Then on 13 June 2012, when he was a judicial officer ﬁof the first gradeﬂ (birinci ), he was transferred to the post of judge at  by an instrument of appointment issued on the same day by the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (Hakimler ve  Yüksek Kurulu Œ ﬁthe HSYKﬂ), after a disciplinary sanction had been imposed on him.When he was a judge in  on 10 February 2015, he applied to the HSYK for leave of absence in order to stand in the twenty-fifth parliamentary elections. In response the HSYK decided that he should be regarded as resigning from his duties with effect from 10 February 2015.1 Term including judges and prosecutors, ﬁmagistratﬂ in French.  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT2Moreover, at the material time, he was chair of Yarsav, an association of judges and prosecutors.B.Background to the case6.  In the Government™s submission, prior to the imposition of the disciplinary sanction which is the subject of the present case, the Ministry of Justice had received two letters of denunciation from C.V. and from U.C., the latter being the press officer of a teachers™ union, on 11 February 2008 and 13 September 2009 respectively.With regard to the first letter, the applicant had been criticised for taking part in a parade to promote secularism.As to the second letter, the author had denounced the applicant™s conduct in relation to several press statements he had made with the alleged aim of influencing the ﬁErgenekonﬂ trial (on this trial, see, among other cases, Özkan v. Turkey (dec.), no. 15869/09, 13 December 2011: in 2007, the Istanbul Public Prosecutor™s Office had initiated a criminal investigation against alleged members of a criminal organisation known as ﬁErgenekonﬂ, all of whom were suspected of engaging in activities aimed at the overthrow by force and violence of the elected government; in a number of indictments, the Istanbul public prosecutor™s office had brought criminal proceedings before the Istanbul Assize Court against several individuals Œ including generals and army officers, members of the intelligence services, businessmen, politicians and journalists Œ for planning a coup d™état with the aim of overthrowing the democratic constitutional order, a crime punishable by life imprisonment, mainly on the basis of Article 312 of the Criminal Code; the defendants in the trial were ultimately acquitted).7.  Again according to the Government, in two letters of 13 and 14 August 2008 certain evidence obtained in the course of a criminal investigation into a terrorist organisation was submitted to the Ministry of Justice with a view to criminal proceedings against the applicant.8.  In the context of two criminal investigations into the ﬁErgenekonﬂ organisation initiated on 14 August and 14 October 2008 (with the approval of the Minister of Justice granted on 15 April and 5 September 2008), the Office of the Inspector General of Justice had applied to the Istanbul Assize Court for authorisation, inter alia, to place under surveillance the telephone line registered in the applicant™s name, in accordance with section 101 of Law no. 2802 on judges and prosecutors (ﬁLaw no. 2802ﬂ).It appears from the file that this request for approval indicated, among other reasons, that the ﬁErgenekonﬂ organisation had a particular structure and that its strict hierarchy prevented its members from knowing each other, that it presented a definite public danger in view of its capacity for action, and that there was no other means of identifying its members or finding out about its action plans. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT3It can also be seen from the file that, on 14 October 2008, the Istanbul Assize Court granted the requested authorisation for a limited period of three months (for details of the phone tapping, see paragraphs 26-35 below).9.  The Government further indicated that, on 17 September 2009, the inspectors investigating the allegations in question had submitted their report, concluding that some of the allegations called for criminal and disciplinary investigations. Since the applicant™s conduct had been considered by the inspectors to require the opening of a criminal investigation, the investigation file had been transmitted to the competent public prosecutor™s office pursuant to section 89 of Law no. 2802 and, in addition, a copy of that file had been submitted to the HSYK pursuant to section 87 of the same Law.C.Disciplinary proceedings against the applicant1.Opening of disciplinary proceedings10.  According to the applicant, on 30 October 2009 the Minister of Justice agreed to open disciplinary proceedings against him (the relevant document was not produced by the parties). The information in the file shows that the applicant stood accused, through his actions and statements, of undermining the dignity and honour of the profession and of having forfeited his personal dignity and esteem.11.  Furthermore, the applicant stated that, in a letter of 12 November 2009, the Directorate General for Criminal Affairs at the Ministry of Justice had informed him of the disciplinary proceedings opened against him and had invited him to submit arguments in his defence.12.  On 10 December 2009 the applicant submitted observations in his defence. He denied all the allegations made against him. In addition, he contested the manner in which the investigation had been conducted, invoked the protection of Articles 6, 8, 10, 11 and 13 of the Convention and maintained that it was his duty to share his views with public opinion.2.Decision of 19 July 201113.  On 19 July 2011 the Second Chamber of the HSYK, sitting as a panel of seven members, namely N.O. (President), A.E.T., A.G., Z.Oz., H.S., A.A. and B.E., issued its decision on the disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. It decided by a majority to impose the sanction of transfer (yer  ) on the applicant pursuant to section 68(2)(a) of Law no. 2802 (see paragraph 39 below) on the ground that, by his statements to the media, he had undermined the dignity and honour of the profession and had forfeited his personal dignity and esteem (  ve nüfuzu ile  onur ve  ) (decision no. 460). v. TURKEY JUDGMENT4The parts of that decision relevant to the present case read as follows (the allegations confirmed at the end of the disciplinary proceedings are indicated in italics Œ see paragraphs 18 and 24 below):ﬁ... The investigation into Judge Ömer Faruk  reveals as follows.(1) He organised a press statement on behalf of Yarsav [association of judges and prosecutors] on the premises of the Court of Cassation on 12 January 2009, in violation of sections 2 and 3 of the Associations Act ...(2) By directly targeting the judges and prosecutors involved in the criminal case known as ‚Ergenekon™ and by making illegal political statements, he sought to influence [the pending case] in breach of Article 277 of the Criminal Code; to achieve this, he took advantage of his official title [and] made statements and criticisms about the investigation procedure and its conduct in favour of certain suspects and defendants in order to influence public opinion.In that connection:(a) On 29 October 2008, at 10.59 a.m., he had a telephone conversation with I.T., a columnist for the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, and discussed with him [the failure to grant] a promotion to Z.O., the prosecutor who was conducting the Ergenekon criminal investigation; after this conversation, he sent a telephone message to certain members of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors and telephoned to correct a number he had given.(b) On 10 January 2009, at 2.13 p.m., during a telephone conversation with M.T.K., he made an appointment [with M.T.K.] to ‚visit M.B., a representative of the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet in Ankara, between 5 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.™.(c) He paid a visit to the office of Cumhuriyet, the daily newspaper for which M.B. [journalist] worked (M.B. having been remanded in custody on charges of ‚membership of a terrorist organisation [and] attempting to overthrow the government of the Republic of Turkey or partially or totally obstructing the performance of its duties™), [a visit which] was described in the 7 March 2009 issue of Cumhuriyet as ‚a support visit™; in the statements he made [during the visit], he criticised the manner in which M.B.™s statement had been taken, in order to put pressure on the public prosecutor.(d) On 21 March 2008 [during his appearance] on the private television channel Kanal Türk, during the programme broadcast at 6.30 p.m., he said the following: ‚... to remand a 91-year-old in custody there must be a suspicion, a suspicion of tampering with evidence and a [risk] of absconding. In these circumstances, you can remand a person in custody. But there are certain rules. If you summon him/her to take a statement, you must comply with the formalities. Otherwise you do not have the power to do what you want and as you like. The procedure has to be complied with [legally] as well ...; I saw the Prime Minister™s statements broadcast on NTV [a private television channel] on 19 February ... and he said: ‚These are the people who harassed us before we came to power. Now we are trying to unmask them™ ... we cannot allow any suspicion to hang over the justice system that a criminal investigation is being carried out to order. In no way can such a doubt be allowed to subsist. Justice must be given to the justice system. It cannot be claimed that a criminal investigation was a ‚success™ of the justice system and the executive [at the same time]. The justice system cannot conduct a criminal investigation together with the executive ... It is the prosecutor who conducts the criminal investigation. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT5(e) In a television programme broadcast on 23 March 2008 ..., he was asked: ‚In the context of the criminal investigation into the alleged terrorist organisation Ergenekon, is the fact that the journalist I.S. was arrested during the night and that this elderly and sick person was held in police custody for 30 hours compatible with democratic [values]?™ and [the applicant] replied as follows: ‚It is not even appropriate to answer that question, it is obvious that [this is not acceptable]. I also want to stress that the European Court of Human Rights has very frequently found violations by Turkey in this regard™. He went on to say: ‚Is it the government that is conducting this criminal investigation on terror? Does the government know about it? Is it the government that is in control? When you look at some of the statements, speeches ..., the Prime Minister says: ﬁWe made some findings before we came to power, now we are trying to reveal themﬂ. This is a serious attack on the investigating authorities; in other words, you are saying that ﬁwe made some findings before we came to power and we have informed the justice system [of them]. It is the justice system which is investigating the matterﬂ. Can the justice system carry out an investigation to order? Such an attack is likely to influence the investigating authorities. Even so, that is not all they are saying ... they add that ﬁup to a certain point, it was the security directorate which conducted the investigation, then handed it over to the justice systemﬂ. Police custody is a possibility, legally speaking. Is it absolutely necessary to take someone into police custody? Is there any suspicion of [a risk of] absconding? You must explain this but you can™t apply it [placement in police custody] in all circumstances. You have to explain the legal basis that can justify the taking of such measures during the night, at a given time. You can do so, you have the power to do so, but you cannot do this whenever you like if there is no necessity and you yourselves must justify this necessity™. The presenter asked him the following question: ‚does that mean that they must demonstrate the need to go and arrest I.S. [the Cumhuriyet columnist] at 4 a.m. at his home?™; he replied as follows: ‚You have to provide some justification for it, otherwise it is an abuse of power, arbitrary conduct.(f) In a telephone conversation on 7 January 2009 at 9.45 p.m., he advised Mr. A.A. that E.A. [that lawyer™s client], who had been arrested in the context of the same criminal investigation [this must be the Ergenekon case], was required to remain silent when interviewed by the security directorate regardless of the questions and that, as lawyer [of that client], he had to submit a request for immediate appearance before the public prosecutor.(g) At the demonstration held at  on 18 April 2009 to protest against the remanding in custody of the university rector  M.H., and other rectors, he made the following statements to journalists: ‚Now it has turned into an attack on science; they have started throwing a ﬁgrenadeﬂ [hiza  (a term used to describe an official warning, of the disciplinary type)] at the judiciary and science; we will not let anyone throw such grenades™.(h) He participated in a round table entitled ‚The Ergenekon Conspiracy, Putting the Judicial System to the Test™ [Ergenekon Tertibi ve  ], held in Germany on 9 May 2009 ..., and said [on that occasion]: ‚in Turkey there is an undeclared state of emergency; they are trying to manipulate public opinion by putting pressure on the judicial system and by human rights violations™.(i) [about a telephone conversation with M.A., Chair of the Istanbul Bar Association](j) In a telephone conversation with I.T., a Cumhuriyet columnist, on 5 March 2009 at 4.10 p.m., in response to a question put by [him] concerning the second time the  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT6columnist M.B. had been taken into police custody, he said: ‚No, it is not possible Mr Ilhan, if he had previously absconded, he should not be released; but he did not abscond [after his release]; they have acted so [improperly], if the court ordered the release, it means that the conditions of detention were not satisfied: he had not absconded or tampered [with evidence]. This was confirmed by a court decision™.(k) [concerning a telephone call from the same journalist, in which he expressed his views on the police custody and detention of M.B.](3) By his attitudes and behaviour, [the applicant] created the conviction that he could not perform his duties in a correct and impartial manner.In this context, in view of his statements about a prosecution known to the public as the ‚Ergenekon case™, [which is] a pending case and [about which the applicant] could have to form an opinion in his capacity as public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation during the examination on points of law, [he] acted not as a public prosecutor but as a politician.(a) On 21 October 2008, at 2.28 p.m., in a telephone conversation that he had with S.Y., a journalist working for the daily newspaper , he openly expressed his views on the disqualification of a judge in charge of the case in question and on the jurisdiction of the court and dictated these views to the journalist, warning him that his name should not appear in the article.(b) On 10 January 2009, at 11.02 p.m., in a telephone conversation with Mr A.A., he asked about the situation of some of the suspects in the Ergenekon case; after Mr A.A. had told him ‚that he had spoken with Mr Turan, who told him that the questioning by the public prosecutor™s office was continuing™, he asked to be ‚kept informed regardless of the time™.(c) In articles published in the 25 January 2007 issues of the daily newspapers Milliyet and Vatan, quoting an article written by [the applicant] and published on a website accessible to lawyers, he stated that ‚the criminal cases concerning Article 301 of the Criminal Code [had been] brought because of pressure from public opinion and the media rather than being assessed from a legal perspective, [that] Hrant [Dink, a Turkish journalist of Armenian origin, murdered in 2007 Œ see Dink v. Turkey, nos. 2668/07 and 4 others, 14 September 2010] [had not been admitted] as a Turk, [and that] this [was] the problem for those who had distorted the ideas of Atatürk (Atatürkçülük) and the Treaty of Lausanne™.(d) During a news programme on the private channel Kanal D broadcast on 28 January 2007, he said: ‚from a legal perspective, Article 301 of the Criminal Code is problematic; in the case of Hrant Dink, as the principal prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, [I] expressed the opinion that the offence had not been committed, that the criminal prosecution had been initiated by ﬁpulling with forcepsﬂ a sentence of the eighth article [written by M. Dink]; the courts ruled by taking into account only the perception of public opinion™.(e) In a documentary on the murder of Hrant Dink published on 8 February 2007 ..., he said ... : ‚The criminal prosecutions relating to Article 301 of the Criminal Code were triggered by pressure from public opinion; whereas from a legal perspective nobody has the right to be a third-party intervener, many [people] have made requests to intervene [in the context of] these cases, [being driven] by different political sensitivities; the statements of the accused are not quoted in full in the press and only some of the statements that are the subject of the proceedings are quoted; the context in which these statements were made is not taken into consideration; the term ﬁTurkishnessﬂ in Article 301 [of the Criminal Code] may also include the judge  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT7who is going to hear the case; [I myself] prepared an opinion that an offence had not been committed by Dink™s article, but the Court of Cassation rejected it™.(f) [about a lunch that the applicant had with an accused in the Ergenekon case](g) [about the applicant™s participation in a meeting at which many of the accused in the Ergenekon case were present](h) [concerning a visit by the applicant to S.K., a former Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, against whom an arrest warrant had been issued](i) [concerning attempts to make a telephone call to H.T., a person who had been remanded in custody in connection with the above-mentioned case and subsequently released on bail due to health problems](j) [about a lunch that the applicant had with another accused person in the same case](k) The statements, attitudes and behaviour listed under (2) (b), (c), (d) and (f) above....(4) By his wrongful conduct and improper relations, he has [undermined] the dignity and honour of the profession and has forfeited his personal dignity and esteem.(a) While serving as a prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, he engaged in speeches and behaviour which are not in keeping with his official position or with the aims and regulations of Yarsav [the association of judges and prosecutors], of which he was chair.For example:(i) At a conference ... he said: ‚... the voice which once spoke out in Çankaya [former residence of the President of the Republic] against the statements of international institutions that cross the line of intervention in the judicial system is no longer speaking out today™.(ii) Regarding a statement by the President of Religious Affairs, A.B., published in the daily newspaper Hürriyet on 8 March 2008, in which he had stated ‚... the compulsory religious education course is against the law; why did the Supreme Administrative Court, which issued [this] decision, not ask for our opinion?™, [the applicant] said the following: ‚the fact that A.B., who had protested in the past about a failure to obtain the opinion of the Islamic clergy (ulema), expressed himself in this way is very unjust, [shows a great] bias, [is] illegal; the fact of directing criticism against the courts, which could only take as a reference national or international legal texts, which could only be based on [these], amount to intervention of religion in the legal field, of the State, [and] is inadmissible in a secular legal order™.(iii) He took part in a meeting held on 9 December 2007 ... and expressed himself as follows on that occasion : ‚In 1969 we were Imran Öktem [former President of the Court of Cassation, known for his pro-secular ideas, who died in 1969], at our [1969] funeral [we were harassed]; in 1978 we were  Öz [public prosecutor, murdered in 1978], they killed us, [but] we continued to practise our profession; in 1992 we were   [public prosecutor, murdered in 1992], they killed us, [but] we continued to practise our profession ..."; in 1995, we were Ali Günday [Chair of the Bar of  murdered in 1995], they killed us, [but] we continued to practise our profession; in 2006, we were Yücel Özbilgin [judge at the Supreme Administrative Court, murdered in 2006], they killed us, [but] we continued  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT8to practise our profession; today they want to enchain the justice system; in the new Constitution, it is the part devoted to the justice system that is undergoing the most significant changes; they are in the process of destroying the independence of the justice system™;(iv) In his statements published on 16 May 2007 in the daily newspapers ..., he said the following: ‚F.K., a former secretary to the Ministry of Justice, who was appointed as Minister of Justice, is not independent [during the election period the Minister of Justice was to be replaced by an independent Minister of Justice]. The fact that he was appointed Minister of Justice enabled him to chair the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, which had lodged a complaint against him] because of his attitude and behaviour during the election of the members of the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court™.(v) In his statements published on 17 August 2007 and 18 August 2007 in the daily newspapers ..., he stated with regard to A. Gül™s candidature for the Presidency of the Republic: ‚The conduct expected of persons against whom legal proceedings have been brought and are still pending is not to become President of the Republic, in order to preserve the honour of the State; the appearance of wives is a message conveyed to society; [consequently,] the fact that the President of the Republic put on display the Islamic headscarf, [a symbol] belonging to a religion and now having acquired a political dimension, through the intermediary of his wife, not as her own personal choice ..., [demonstrates that] he could not act independently of religion and that he has supported the spread of the Islamic headscarf™.(vi) In his interview with The Guardian on 28 July 2008, he said : ‚The AKP [Adalet ve  Partisi - Justice and Development Party], the ruling party, was seeking a system of sharia law that would destroy the country™s secular system. The government had exposed its true agenda in a series of measures, including attempts to establish halal standards in food production, signing bilateral agreements underwritten by "Islamic laws" with fellow Muslim countries, increasing religious education at State schools and allowing female students to wear headscarves at university; the moves were aimed at reviving an Islamic consciousness dormant since the end of the Ottoman Empire, leading to a religious society where secular lifestyles were discouraged and women denied equal status™.(vii) In his interview entitled ‚The Prime Minister™s statements on the warnings of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation™ published on 22 January 2008 in the daily Cumhuriyet, he said the following: ‚the courts are not bodies that act upon the requests of the legislature and the executive; the political authority cannot change the concept of freedom of expression and must not, through actions and speeches, prepare the ground for the erasure of judicial decisions with which it must comply; the political leadership must abandon [the idea] of making a target for such speeches, which are incompatible with law and democracy; the political leadership, which is not satisfied with this situation, has sought to devalue the role of the judiciary in the current system; in this context, the political leadership has demonstrated its aim of rendering the courts passive vis-à-vis the legislature and the executive in the draft Constitution; the political authority must abandon its vision of superiority; the supremacy of law is fundamental; it must not be forgotten that in a State governed by the rule of law there are areas in which the power of the majority cannot allow everything; it [the political authority] must not create unfounded expectations and tensions over matters that cannot be changed from a legal perspective.™ v. TURKEY JUDGMENT9(viii) [In the interview published] in the daily newspapers on 31 January 2008 ... and broadcast on the television channel ..., he expressed himself as follows: ‚The amendment relating to the Islamic headscarf is not compatible with revolutionary laws; this situation will have consequences which are capable of changing the social structure and overturning the current secular system ...; this is the main reason why the courts could not recognise freedom of dress; even though the European Court of Human Rights has noted this situation, it is astonishing to see that the Turkish legislature, symbol of the war of independence, does not take it into account™.(ix-xviii) [regarding numerous statements by the applicant published in daily newspapers or broadcast on private television channels, and regarding a statement by the applicant published in the 31 January 2008 issue of the daily newspaper Hürriyet on the wearing of Islamic headscarves by female students](xix) [concerning several telephone conversations on the political activities of a political party]4.b He passed on information to certain individuals and the media, [which is] incompatible with his position as prosecutor at the Court of Cassation....(5) [concerning conduct which does not respect the secrecy of the judicial investigation]...(6) [concerning failure to comply with working hours].ﬂ14.  In reaching its decision, the Second Chamber of the HSYK took into account the conduct and statements listed in paragraphs 2 and 4 in their entirety, and also those listed in paragraph 3, sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), (i) and (k).It took the view, inter alia, that, by directly targeting the judges and prosecutors involved in the Ergenekon criminal case and by making unlawful political statements, the applicant had sought to influence the pending case and that, to that end, he had taken advantage of his official title and had made statements and criticisms about the investigation and in support of certain suspects and defendants in order to influence public opinion. It further found that, by his attitudes and conduct in relation to the Hrant Dink and Ergenekon cases Œ judgments which could be appealed against on points of law and thus be examined by the Court of Cassation, where he might thus be called upon to submit a legal opinion Œ the applicant had created the conviction that he could not carry out his duties in a correct and impartial manner and had acted not as a public prosecutor but as a politician.The parts of the conclusion of this decision that are relevant to the present case read as follows:ﬁWhile he was serving as prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, [the applicant] engaged in speeches and conduct which were not in keeping with his official position or the aims and regulations of Yarsav, of which he was chair; he had contacts with certain individuals in a manner that was incompatible with his office ..., and he passed  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT10on information on various subjects to the media in a manner that was inappropriate to his position as prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. [As a result,] he has [undermined] the dignity and prestige of the profession and has forfeited his personal dignity and esteem. [Consequently], the sanction of disciplinary transfer must be imposed on him, pursuant to section 68(2)(a) of Law no. 2802 ...ﬂ3.The applicant™s request for review of the 19 July 2011 decision15.  On 20 February 2012 the applicant applied to the Second Chamber of the HSYK for a review of its decision of 19 July 2011. In support of his request, he complained in particular about a lack of reasoning in the decision and relied, inter alia, on his right to freedom of expression.16.  On 29 March 2012 the Second Chamber of the HSYK dismissed the application for a review of its decision.4.The applicant™s appeal to the HSYK™s Plenary Assembly17.  The applicant appealed against the decision of 19 July 2011 before the Plenary Assembly of the HSYK.18.  On 6 June 2012 the Plenary Assembly, consisting of seventeen members including five members of the Second Chamber, and sitting as an appellate formation, gave its decision in which it rejected the applicant™s appeal in so far as it concerned the above-mentioned points 2 (c), (d), (e), (g) and (h), point 3 (c), (d) and (e) and point 4 (a) (i-viii), and upheld the disciplinary sanction in question.It took the view, however, that some of the allegations listed in the above-mentioned point 2 (a), (b), (f), (i), (j) and (k), point 3 (a), (b) and (i), point 4 (a) xix, and point 4 (b) (i-x), were based on the transcriptions of bilateral telephone communications and that their content was not of such a nature or seriousness as to call for the imposition of a sanction. It decided that it was not necessary to impose a sanction in respect of the accusations concerning the said telephone conversations.As the HSYK decided not to amend the disciplinary sanction, the transfer of post imposed on the applicant thus became final.5.The applicant™s disciplinary transfer19.  The case file shows that, during the disciplinary investigation, the applicant was appointed to a new post as judge in Istanbul. After the disciplinary sanction became final, by a decision of 13 June 2012, the First Chamber of the HSYK decided to transfer him to a post of judge in 6.The applicant™s request for rectification of the decision of 6 June 201220.  On 5 October 2012 the applicant submitted a request for rectification of the decision of 6 June 2012. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT1121.  On 7 November 2012 the HSYK declared that request inadmissible, taking the view that the decision of 6 June 2012, following an appeal by the applicant, had become final, pursuant to section 33 of Law no. 6087.7.Review of the disciplinary sanction following the entry into force of Law no. 657222.  On 2 December 2014, following the entry into force of Law no. 6572, a transitional provision was added to Law no. 2802 (transitional section 19 of Law no. 6572). This provision allowed judges and prosecutors to apply to the Plenary Assembly of the HSYK for a review of disciplinary sanctions imposed on them pursuant, inter alia, to section 68 of Law no. 2802 for acts committed between 14 February 2005 and 1 September 2013.23.  On 6 January 2015, on the basis of transitional section 19 of Law no. 6572, the applicant applied to the HSYK for a review of the disciplinary sanction imposed on him.24.  In a decision of 15 April 2015 the HSYK decided to review the disciplinary sanction and to give the applicant a reprimand instead.The parts of that decision relevant to the present case read as follows:ﬁ... The request for review ... has been examined and it has been unanimously decided ... to impose the sanction of reprimand pursuant to section 65(2)(a) of Law no. 2802, in place of the sanction of disciplinary transfer, which was decided on 19 July 2011 and became final on 6 June 2012 for the acts listed in points 2 (c), (d), (e), (g), (h), 3 (c), (d), (e), 4 (a) (i-viii) ...ﬂ25.  In a decision of 7 October 2015 the HSYK™s Plenary Assembly rejected the applicant™s request for a review of the decision of 15 April 2015 (a copy of that request was not produced by the parties).D.Phone tapping and criminal proceedings26.  On a date not specified in the file, criminal proceedings were brought in the Court of Cassation against the applicant for violation of Articles 277 and 288 of the Criminal Code, ultimately resulting in his acquittal on the charges brought under those provisions (judgment of the Court of Cassation of 3 June 2010).27.  Furthermore, in the context of two criminal investigations initiated on 14 August and 14 October 2008, the Office of the Inspector General of Justice submitted to the Istanbul Assize Court a request for authorisation, inter alia, to place under surveillance the telephone registered in the applicant™s name, under section 101 of Law no. 2802 (information supplied by the Government; see paragraph 8 above).28.  On 14 October 2008 the Istanbul Assize Court granted the requisite authorisation for a limited period of three months. In so doing, it stated, among other reasons, that the ﬁErgenekonﬂ organisation had a special  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT12structure and that its strict hierarchy prevented its members from knowing each other, that it presented a definite public danger in view of its capacity for action, and that there was no other means of identifying its members and finding out about its action plans.29.  On 14 January 2009 the inspectors conducting the investigation requested an extension of the telephone surveillance.30.  On 15 January 2009 the Istanbul Assize Court granted the requested extension for three months, reiterating the reasons given in the earlier decision. According to a document in the file, the interception of the applicant™s telephone calls was discontinued at the end of that period (namely on 14 April 2009).31.  On 19 January 2009, after examining the reports relating to the first period of telephone tapping, the inspectors took the view that the recorded conversations fell within the ordinary law for the purposes of section 93 of Law no. 2802 and Article 250 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, these reports were forwarded to the Istanbul Public Prosecutor™s Office responsible for organised crime.32.  On 28 December 2009 the above-mentioned public prosecutor discontinued the investigation. In so deciding he took the view that the evidence gathered did not make it possible to say that the judges or prosecutors in question Œ including the applicant Œ had provided assistance or support to the organisation in question. Taking the view that the actions of one of the judges might require an individual disciplinary or criminal investigation, he referred this part of the case to the Ministry of Justice. Furthermore, relying on Article 17 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he stated that since the suspects had not been called to give evidence in the investigation against them, it was not necessary to notify them of his decision. In addition, he ordered the destruction of the material obtained in the course of the surveillance and the drawing-up of a report to that effect, together with notification of the telephone surveillance to the persons concerned.33.  In a letter of 31 December 2009 marked ﬁconfidentialﬂ, the Istanbul public prosecutor in charge of the investigation sent the applicant, at his office in  under Article 137 §§ 3 and 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an information note on the discontinuance of the proceedings and the destruction of the material gathered during the surveillance. According to the information in the file, on the same date the records of the telephone tapping were destroyed by the Istanbul Public Prosecutor™s Office in accordance with the discontinuance decision. On 5 January 2010 the computer media carrying the recordings in question were in turn destroyed by the same authorities.34.  On 23 March 2012 the applicant appealed against the decision of 28 December 2009 to discontinue the case and requested the destruction of all the data obtained through the interception of his communications. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT1335.  In a decision of 22 May 2012 the Assize Court in Ankara dismissed the applicant™s appeal, noting that the records of the intercept evidence had already been destroyed.II.RELEVANT DOMESTIC LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND PRACTICEA.The status of prosecutors in the Turkish judicial system36.  The Turkish judicial system does not make a fundamental distinction between the status of judges and prosecutors: first, the HSYK takes decisions regarding the admission of judges and prosecutors into the profession, their appointment, their transfer to other posts, their promotion and the supervision of judges and prosecutors in the performance of their duties (see Article 159, paragraphs 8-9, of the Constitution). Moreover, under Law no. 2802 on judges and prosecutors, they are subject, among other things, to the same provisions relating to their careers and disciplinary proceedings. In particular, Article 139 of the Turkish Constitution reads as follows:ﬁJudges and public prosecutors shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution; nor shall they be deprived of their salaries, allowances or other rights relating to their status, even as a result of the abolition of a court or post.ﬂB.The Constitution37.  The HSYK (the ﬁHigh Council of Judges and Prosecutorsﬂ, which has become the ﬁCouncil of Judges and Prosecutorsﬂ since the constitutional reform of 2017) is a body constituted under Article 159 of the Constitution, as amended on 12 September 2010 by Law no. 5982. At the relevant time this provision read as follows:ﬁThe High Council of Judges and Prosecutors shall be established and shall exercise its functions in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts and the security of tenure of the judiciary.The High Council of Judges and Prosecutors shall have a total of twenty-two full members and twelve substitute members; it shall comprise three chambers.The Minister of Justice shall be the chair of the Council.

TURKEY JUDGMENT14elected from among the judges and public prosecutors of the first grade [with the requisite qualifications for classification in the first grade] at the civil courts; three full members and two substitutes shall be elected from among the judges and public prosecutors of the first grade [with the requisite qualifications for classification in the first grade] at the administrative courts. [The members thus appointed] may be re-elected on the expiry of their term of office.The election of members to the Council shall be held within sixty days before the expiry of the term of office of the member in question. In case of a vacancy concerning a member appointed by the President of the Republic, before the expiry of the term of office, the new member shall be appointed within sixty days from the date on which the vacancy occurs. In the event of a vacancy in respect of any other member [the full member shall be replaced by the substitute member for] the remaining period of the term of office.In the elections in which [the members of the general assemblies of the Court of Cassation, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Justice Academy of Turkey vote for] members to be elected to the Council [from among their peers] and in which [judges and prosecutors] vote for the members to be elected to the Council from among the judges and prosecutors of the first grade from civil and administrative courts, the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes shall be elected as full members and as substitute members, respectively. These elections shall take place once for every term of office and by secret ballot.The full members of the Council, other than the Minister of Justice and the Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, may not assume any duties other than those prescribed by law or be appointed or elected to another office by the Council during their term of office.The administration and the representation of the Council are carried out by the Chair of the Council. The Chair of the Council shall not participate in the work of the chambers. The Council shall elect the presidents of chambers from among its members and one Deputy Chair from among the presidents of chambers. The Chair [of the Council] may delegate some of his/her powers to the Deputy Chair.The Council shall take decisions regarding the admission of judges and public prosecutors of civil and administrative courts into the profession, appointments, transfers to other posts, the delegation of temporary powers, promotions, and admission to the first grade, decisions concerning those whose continuation in the profession is found to be unsuitable, the imposition of disciplinary sanctions and removal from office; it shall take final decisions on proposals by the Ministry of Justice concerning the abolition of a court, or changes in the territorial jurisdiction of a court; it shall also exercise the other functions vested in it by the Constitution and legislation.As to the supervision of judges and public prosecutors with regard to the performance of their duties in accordance with laws, rules, regulations and circulars ... enquiries and investigations concerning them shall be carried out by the Council™s inspectors, upon the proposal of the relevant chambers and with the permission of the Chair of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors. ...The decisions of the Council, other than dismissal from the profession, shall not be subject to judicial review.A Secretariat General shall be established under the Council. The Secretary General shall be appointed by the Chair of the Council from among three candidates nominated by the Council from among judges and public prosecutors of the first  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT15grade. The Council is empowered to appoint, with their consent, the Council™s inspectors, judges, and public prosecutors to temporary or permanent functions [within the Council]. ... The election of the members of the Council, the formation of the chambers and the division of tasks between chambers, the duties of the Council and its chambers, the quorum for meetings and decision-making, the operating procedures and principles, [the possibility of] appealing against the decisions and proceedings of the chambers and the procedure for examining such appeals, and the establishment and the duties of the Secretariat General, shall be laid down in law.ﬂPrior to the constitutional reform of 2010, paragraph 10 of that provision read as follows:ﬁDecisions of the Council shall not be amenable to judicial review.ﬂ38.  Article 159 of the Constitution was amended in the constitutional reform of 2017. Henceforth, the Council of Judges and Prosecutors is composed of fifteen members and has two chambers. The Chair of the Council is always the Minister of Justice and the Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Justice is an ex officio member. The President of the Republic appoints four members. The other seven members are appointed by the Grand National Assembly.C.Judges and Prosecutors Act (Law no. 2802)39.  The relevant provisions of Law no. 2802, on appointments by way of transfer, read as follows:Section 15 Œ Grades and seniorityﬁThere shall be four grades for judges and prosecutors: third grade, second grade, reserved-for-first grade, and first grade.Those who successfully complete three years in the reserved-for-first grade category, and provided that they have not lost their credentials to advance to first grade, shall advance to first grade....ﬂSection 32 - Conditions for the reserved-for-first-gradeﬁIn order to advance to the reserved-for-first grade, the following conditions must be fulfilled:(a) to have advanced to the first [highest] step,(b) to have completed at least ten years of service in the post of a judge or a prosecutor,(c) to have a proven track record in professional and scientific knowledge,(d) not to have received the sanction of disciplinary transfer,(e) not to have received more than once the sanction of reprimand, deferment of advancement to a higher grade or deferment of promotion, v.

Under section 102 of Law no. 2802, the reference salary of judges and prosecutors shall correspond to the gross amount of all the remuneration paid to the civil servant holding the highest post. Under section 103 of the same Law, the highest ranking judges and prosecutors, such as the President of the Court of Cassation and the President of the Supreme Administrative Court, shall receive the full reference salary, whereas the newly recruited judges and prosecutors shall receive 41% thereof. Judges and prosecutors of the first grade shall receive a gradual increase in their gross salary of 2% every three years, for as long as they remain eligible for appointment to the Court of Cassation or Supreme Administrative Court. In any event, their rate of remuneration shall not be higher than 83%, the rate applicable to judges of the Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court.D.Law no. 6087 on the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (known as the ﬁCouncil of Judges and Prosecutorsﬂ since the constitutional reform of 2017)41.  The relevant provisions of Law no. 6087 on the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors, as in force at the relevant time, read as follows:Section 1ﬁThe purpose of this Law is to govern the establishment, organisation, duties, powers and working procedures and principles of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors in compliance with the principle of independence of the courts and tenure of judges and prosecutors.ﬂSection 3ﬁ(1) The High Council for Judges and Prosecutors shall consist of twenty-two full and twelve substitute members. v.

Under Law no. 6087, as in force at the time, in his capacity as Chair of the HSYK, the Minister of Justice held significant powers, in particular to draw up the agenda of the Council, to appoint the Secretary General and to approval proposals to bring disciplinary proceedings made by the competent chamber of the HSYK (third Chamber), thus giving him a right of veto over disciplinary investigations against judges or prosecutors. He was not, however, entitled to attend meetings of the Plenary Assembly concerning disciplinary proceedings or to sit in any of the chambers or to participate in the transactions thereof. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT21E.Relevant leading decisions of the HSYK43.  In their observations the Government referred to the leading decision taken by the HSYK on 8 April 2015 concerning the assessment of the performance of judges and prosecutors. According to the Government, the performance of judges and prosecutors of the first grade was assessed every three years from the date of their admission to that grade (Article 5 of above-mentioned decision) and, in order to receive a promotion, those concerned had to meet the requirements specified in that decision, without having forfeited the qualifications required for access to the first grade (Article 6 of that decision).In addition, the Government produced the leading decision of the HSYK on the admission of judges and prosecutors to the first grade dated 11 April 1983 (published in the Official Gazette on 1 May 1983). Under Article 5 of that decision, judges and prosecutors eligible for promotion to the first grade must not have received the sanction of disciplinary transfer and must not have received, more than once, a lesser sanction such as a reprimand or the deferment of advancement to a higher step or rank.F.Relevant provisions concerning the interception and recording of communications44.  The relevant provisions concerning the interception and recording of communications can be found in the  v. Turkey (no. 30083/10, §§ 39-48, 7 June 2016) judgment.III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE45.  The relevant international law and practice in the present case can be found in the Baka v. Hungary [GC] (no. 20261/12, §§ 72-87, ECHR 2016) and Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine (no. 21722/11, §§ 78-80, ECHR 2013) judgments.Interim opinion of European Commission for democracy through law (Venice Commission)46.  At its 85th Plenary Session (17-18 December 2010) the European Commission for democracy through law adopted an interim opinion on the Draft Law on the High Council for judges and prosecutors (of 27 September 2010) of Turkey (document CDL-AD(2010)042). The relevant extracts from that opinion read as follows:ﬁA. System for the organisation of the judiciary17. In order to understand the new reform of the HSYK, an understanding of the general organisation of the Turkish judiciary is necessary, in particular the system for  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT22the qualification, appointment, transfer and dismissal of judges and prosecutors, as well as supervision, complaints, inspection and disciplinary measures.18. In comparison with most European countries, the system for the organisation of the judiciary in Turkey is highly centralised, rather strict, provides for wide powers of supervision and inspection and has a large institutional framework. Combined with a certain tradition for politicising the administration and controlling the judiciary, this explains why the issue of the composition and competences of the HSYK is of such paramount importance not only to the Turkish judiciary itself, but also to political and public life in general. Under this system, most aspects of the organisation of judges and prosecutors have been handled directly by the authorities in Ankara, including qualification, appointments, transfers, dismissals, complaints, disciplinary actions, etc....21. Up until the present reform, the competences to administer and supervise the judiciary and prosecution service were, to a large extent, divided between the Ministry of Justice and the HSYK, with the Ministry itself responsible for many of the tasks. ... This system has now been substantially reformed. The number of members of the HSYK was increased from 7 to 22 (with 12 substitutes), with a much broader and more pluralistic composition. The HSYK was given the status of a separate and independent public legal entity, with its own budget, administrative staff and premises. Most of the relevant competences that formerly belonged to the Ministry of Justice were transferred exclusively to the HSYK as an independent institution.22. To understand the new changes, it is important to note that this is an institutional reform which, for the most part, concerns the top layer of the judicial administrative structure in Turkey. It is the management of the judicial administration that is being changed, and moved from the Ministry of Justice and the former HSYK to the much more independent and pluralistically composed new HSYK. The underlying administrative structure seems not to have undergone any major changes, except for having moved formally and physically from the Ministry of Justice to the HSYK. This includes the existing judges, the Inspection Board and the rest of the administrative staff.23. The result is that the new HSYK has been established as a strong and separate new institution not only in legal, but also in actual terms. It is large, consisting of the 22 members (of which 20 are full time), some 40 judge rapporteurs, the Inspection Board with approximately 160 inspectors (judges by training) and ordinary staff amounting to around 380 people. Altogether this is now an institution with approximately 600 people, in a large 15-story building in central Ankara ...B. General observations on the new reform of the HSYK...27. When studying Article 159 and the draft Law on HSYK, it is evident that the Turkish authorities are familiar with the European standards laid down by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and by the Venice Commission in its earlier reports and opinions. The draft Law on HSYK reflects the criteria of the Venice Commission on a number of points, and should, in general, be welcomed as a substantive and definite step in the right direction. In particular, the Venice Commission welcomes: the increase in the number of members of the HSYK; the pluralistic composition of the HSYK, with 10 of the members elected by their peers; v. TURKEY JUDGMENT23 the institutionalisation of the HSYK as a separate legal entity with public law status, administrative autonomy, and with its own budget, premises and staff; the wide transfer of power from the Ministry of Justice to the HSYK, both as regards legal competences, staff and resources; the substantial reduction in the power and position of the Minister for Justice as President of the HSYK; the creation of an internal appeals system, and the introduction of judicial review against decisions that are still made by the President (Minister for Justice).28. The new HSYK is formally a much more independent institution than its predecessor, and the new system formally fulfils most European standards. However, at the same time, the Venice Commission has noted that there is considerable controversy in Turkey as to whether the new HSYK will in fact prove to be a more independent and impartial institution ...29. While many of the new rules on the HSYK are in line with European standards, there are some issues that still require attention, and which will be dealt with in the following parts of this Opinion.C. Composition and elections of the HSYK...34. While the Venice Commission, in general, supports the new composition of the HSYK, it regrets the fact that Parliament is not included in the processes of appointing members to the HSYK. It is advisable for judicial councils to include members who are not themselves representatives of the judicial branch. But, such members should preferably be appointed by the legislative branch instead of by the executive....H. Judicial review74. Article 7.2.c of the draft Law on HSYK establishes the competence of the HSYK™s Plenary Assembly to: ‚examine and render decisions about the objections raised against the decisions taken by the chambers™.75. Article 33 adds that the re-examination of decisions ‚established for the first time™ by the Plenary Assembly and of those of the chambers may be requested by the President or ‚the concerned ones™ within 10 days after notification of the decisions themselves; complaints can also be made in respect of decisions pertaining to discipline; the Plenary Assembly decisions are final and no appeal may be made to judicial authorities for decisions of the Plenary Assembly and chambers other than those for the removal of office (i.e. dismissal), which are dealt with by the Council of State. as the first instance court. Judicial review of the acts of the Council concerning judges should be required by adopting a bureaucratic model, regulated by law.76. In addition, as far as disciplinary deliberations are concerned, one could argue that the HSYK is a superior judicial organ and that therefore the provisions of the draft Law on HSYK are in line with European standards, as set out in Principle VI.3 of Recommendation No. R(94)12. However, in the information the Venice Commission received from the Turkish authorities, the HSYK is frequently defined as an administrative body. The position taken by the Venice Commission is that an appeal to a court has to be provided as an additional safeguard of the independence of the judiciary and as a guarantee for the persons concerned. This should apply not only  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT24to disciplinary decisions, but also to other decisions which affect the interests and rights of judges and prosecutors....ﬂTHE LAWI.PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS47.  The Government first asked the Court to declare the application inadmissible for abuse of the right of application. They stated that the applicant had failed to inform the Court that the disciplinary sanction at issue had been replaced by a reprimand. In their view, the withdrawal of the disciplinary transfer, which was the subject of the application, had a direct effect on the case. Accordingly, the applicant™s alleged failure to provide the Court with any information on this matter, which was essential for the resolution of the case, constituted an abuse of the right of individual application.48.  Secondly, the Government invited the Court to dismiss the application on the ground that the applicant lacked victim status. They submitted that the sanction of disciplinary transfer imposed on the applicant, having become final on 6 June 2012, had subsequently been annulled by the HSYK. They stated that, in a decision of 15 April 2015, the HSYK had granted the applicant™s request under Law no. 6572 and had decided to review the sanction in question and replace it with a reprimand. They therefore took the view that the applicant no longer had victim status within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention and that the application was incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention.49.  The Court reiterates that, under Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention, an application may be rejected as an abuse of the right of individual application if, among other reasons, it was knowingly based on untrue facts (see Gross v. Switzerland [GC], no. 67810/10, § 28, ECHR 2014; Kerechashvili v. Georgia (dec.), no. 5667/02, 2 May 2006;  and Others v. Latvia, no. 798/05, § 63, 15 September 2009; and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano v. Italy [GC], no. 38433/09, § 97, ECHR 2012). Incomplete and therefore misleading information may also amount to abuse of the right of application, especially if the information concerns the very core of the case and no sufficient explanation is given for the failure to disclose that information (see Hüttner v. Germany (dec.), no. 23130/04, 9 June 2006; Predescu v. Romania, no. 21447/03, §§ 25-26, 2 December 2008; and Kowal v. Poland (dec.), no. 2912/11, 18 September 2012). The same applies where new, significant developments occur during the proceedings before the Court and where Œ despite being expressly required to do so by Rule 47 § 6 of the Rules of Court Œ the applicant fails to disclose that information to the Court, thereby preventing it from ruling on the case  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT25in full knowledge of the facts (see Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano, cited above, § 97, and  and Others, cited above, § 63). However, even in such cases, the applicant™s intention to mislead the Court must always be established with sufficient certainty (see Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria, no. 50963/99, § 89, 20 June 2002; Melnik v. Ukraine, no. 72286/01, §§ 58-60, 28 March 2006; Nold v. Germany, no. 27250/02, § 87, 29 June 2006; and Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. and Di Stefano, cited above, § 97).50.  In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant™s complaints relate to the disciplinary sanction imposed on him on 19 July 2011, which became final on 6 June 2012, that is to say, before the application was lodged. It can be seen from the file that this sanction was indeed enforced, since the applicant, who was serving as a judge in Istanbul, was transferred on 13 June 2012 to  (see paragraph 19 above). The Court also notes that, in his application form, the applicant provided full information about his complaints.It is acknowledged that Law no. 6572 of 2 December 2014 Œ enacted after the present application was lodged Œ afforded the applicant the possibility of requesting a review of the disciplinary sanction in question. The applicant duly availed himself of that remedy, exercising it after lodging his application, and this enabled him to obtain the conversion of his disciplinary sanction, but not its total annulment, and thus none of the consequences that would have resulted therefrom. The disciplinary transfer, which had already been enforced, was replaced by a milder sanction, namely a reprimand, for the same conduct as that which had been the subject of the original disciplinary proceedings (see paragraph 24 above).51.  Admittedly, the Court notes that the severity and consequences of the two sanctions are not identical. While the imposition of the sanction of disciplinary transfer, which is the second harshest sanction after dismissal, automatically prevents a judge or prosecutor from being promoted to the first grade, a single reprimand does not produce such consequences (see paragraphs 39-40 above). That being said, it is not argued in the present case that the conversion of the initial sanction, which constitutes a new fact occurring after the lodging of the present application, retroactively led to the consequences of that sanction being erased. Moreover, it is apparent from the decision of 15 April 2015 that the disciplinary accusations against the applicant remained unchanged (see paragraph 24 above). It should also be borne in mind that the applicant™s complaints related to the initial sanction, which was only reduced after he lodged his application. In those circumstances, it cannot be concluded that the applicant had, from the outset of the proceedings, failed to inform the Court of one or more elements that would have been essential to the consideration of the case. Accordingly, there is no reason to consider that there has been an abuse of the right of individual application in the present case and the Government™s objection in that connection should therefore be dismissed. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT2652.  As to the applicant™s victim status, the Court reiterates that according to its settled case-law, a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a ﬁvictimﬂ unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 10511/10, § 83, 26 April 2016). In the present case, as indicated above, the review of the disciplinary sanction, which had already been enforced, did not enable the applicant to benefit from the complete annulment of the measure, with all the consequences that would have stemmed therefrom, and the disciplinary accusations against him remained unchanged. Consequently, the decision of 15 April 2015 cannot be regarded as an acknowledgment, not even in substance, of the violation of the Convention rights alleged by the applicant or as a measure of redress.Accordingly, the objection submitted in this connection by the Government must also be rejected.II.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION53.  Under Article 6 of the Convention the applicant complained that there had been no judicial review of the disciplinary proceedings against him and that this had been in breach of his right of access to a court.Moreover, he argued that the proceedings before the HSYK concerning the impugned disciplinary sanction had not been compatible with the requirements of independence and impartiality.Lastly, he complained that the decisions given in his case lacked reasoning.The Court finds that the applicant™s complaints should be examined under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, of which the relevant part reads as follows: ﬁ1.  In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...ﬂA.Admissibility1.The parties™ submissions54.  The Government submitted that Article 6 of the Convention was inapplicable in its civil aspect, as no ﬁcivilﬂ rights were, in their view, at issue. They maintained that the dispute was entirely a matter of public law and pointed out that domestic law did not afford the applicant any possibility of seeking judicial review of the HSYK™s decision, since in their view the applicant™s status as a judge/prosecutor was in principle an obstacle to the applicability of Article 6. They argued that, whilst domestic law did not provide the applicant with the possibility of having his claims  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT27examined by a tribunal, such restriction on the right of access to a court was justified in the present case in the light of the case-law stemming from Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland ([GC], no. 63235/00, ECHR 2007-II), taking into account the nature of the applicant™s employment and the subject-matter of the dispute at issue. They referred to the Court™s case-law on the subject, including, inter alia, Serdal Apay v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 3964/05, 11 December 2007) and  v. Turkey (no. 20999/04, § 30, 19 October 2010). They concluded that the complaints under Article 6 were incompatible ratione materiae with the Convention.55.  Referring to the criteria set out in the Vilho Eskelinen and Others judgment (cited above), the Government also submitted that the applicant was a prosecutor at the Court of Cassation and consequently held a high-ranking position in the administration of justice. In their view, he was therefore exercising powers conferred by public law and performed duties consisting in safeguarding the general interests of the State.56.  The Government also pointed out, on the basis of the HSYK™s leading decision on the assessment of the performance of judges and prosecutors, that those in the first grade were subject to such assessment every three years from the date of their admission to that grade and that, in order to be promoted, they had to meet the requirements specified in that decision, without having forfeited the qualifications required for admission to the first grade. The Government further made the following specific points: on the date when the sanction of disciplinary transfer was imposed on the applicant, he had been receiving a reference salary corresponding to a rate of pay of 81%; since the sanction was replaced by a reprimand, an adjustment of his reference salary to a rate of 83% had become possible on account of the fact that he had not forfeited the qualifications required for classification in the first grade; consequently, if he had continued to exercise the profession of judge or prosecutor, he would have obtained a 2% increase in view of the replacement of the initial sanction by a reprimand.57.  The applicant contested these arguments. In his application form he contended that the disciplinary sanction imposed on him had entailed negative and detrimental consequences for his career. This measure had prevented him from being appointed to a high-ranking judicial position and from working in certain judicial districts. In addition, he claimed that he had not been able to receive an indemnity on a permanent basis.2.The Court™s assessment58.  The Court observes that it has not been argued by either party that Article 6 § 1 is applicable in its criminal aspect. The proceedings at issue did not concern the determination of a criminal charge and therefore the criminal limb of that Article is not engaged (see, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 93-95, and Denisov v. Ukraine [GC], no. 76639/11, § 43, 25 September 2018). v. TURKEY JUDGMENT28(a)Relevant principles on the applicability of the civil limb of Article 6 § 159.  The Court reiterates that for Article 6 § 1 in its ﬁcivilﬂ limb to be applicable, there must be a dispute (ﬁcontestationﬂ in the French text) over a ﬁrightﬂ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law, irrespective of whether it is protected under the Convention. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and, finally, the result of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 § 1 into play (see, among many other authorities, Boulois v. Luxembourg [GC], no. 37575/04, § 90, ECHR 2012; Bochan v. Ukraine (no. 2) [GC], no. 22251/08, § 42, ECHR 2015; Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish and Others v. Romania [GC], no. 76943/11, § 71, 29 November 2016; and Regner v. Czech Republic GC, no. 35289/11, § 99, 19 September 2017).60.  It should further be noted that the scope of the ﬁcivilﬂ concept in Article 6 is not limited by the immediate subject matter of the dispute. Instead, the Court has developed a wider approach, according to which the ﬁcivilﬂ limb has covered cases which might not initially appear to concern a civil right but which may have direct and significant repercussions on a private pecuniary or non-pecuniary right belonging to an individual. Through this approach, the civil limb of Article 6 has been applied to a variety of disputes which may have been classified in domestic law as public-law disputes. These examples include disciplinary proceedings concerning the right to practise a profession (see Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, 23 June 1981, §§ 47 and 48, Series A no. 43, and Philis v. Greece (no. 2), 27 June 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV), disputes involving the right to a healthy environment (see  and Others v. Turkey, no. 46117/99, § 133, ECHR 2004-X), prisoners™ detention arrangements (see Ganci v. Italy, no. 41576/98, § 25, ECHR 2003-XI, and Enea v. Italy [GC], no. 74912/01, § 103, ECHR 2009), the right of access to investigation documents (see Savitskyy v. Ukraine, no. 38773/05, §§ 143-45, 26 July 2012), disputes regarding the non-inclusion of a conviction in a criminal record (see Alexandre v. Portugal, no. 33197/09, §§ 54 and 55, 20 November 2012), proceedings for the application of a non-custodial preventive measure (see De Tommaso v. Italy [GC], no. 43395/09, § 154, ECHR 2017 (extracts)), and the revocation of a civil servant™s security clearance within the Ministry of Defence (see Regner, cited above, §§ 113-27).61.  Moreover, as regards the ﬁcivilﬂ nature of such a right within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention, the Court would point out that, according to its case-law, disputes between a State and its civil servants fall in principle within the scope of this provision unless the following two conditions are fulfilled in the aggregate: first, the State in its national law  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT29must have expressly excluded access to a court for the post or category of staff in question; secondly, the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State™s interest (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 62).62.  The Court further points out that the scope of the ﬁcivilﬂ limb has been substantially extended in relation to public-employment disputes, a field which is directly relevant to the present case. In Vilho Eskelinen and Others (cited above) the Court, having regard to the existing state of affairs in the Contracting States and in view of non-discrimination considerations in relation to civil servants as compared to private employees, established a presumption that Article 6 applied to ﬁordinary labour disputesﬂ between a civil servant and the State and that it would be for the respondent Government to show that a civil servant did not have a right of access to a court under national law and that this exclusion of the rights under Article 6 was justified (ibid., § 62). On the basis of the principles set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others, Article 6 has been applied to employment disputes involving judges who were dismissed from judicial office (see, for example, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, §§ 91 and 96; Kulykov and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 5114/09 and 17 others, §§ 118 and 132, 19 January 2017; Sturua v. Georgia, no. 45729/05, § 27, 28 March 2017; and Kamenos v. Cyprus, no. 147/07, § 88, 31 October 2017), removed from an administrative position without the termination of their duties as a judge (see, Baka, cited above, §§ 34 and 107-11, and Denisov, cited above, §§ 25 and 47-48), suspended from judicial office (see Paluda v. Slovakia, no. 33392/12, § 34, 23 May 2017) or otherwise subjected to a disciplinary sanction (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá v. Portugal [GC], nos. 55391/13 and 2 others, §§ 119-20, 6 November 2018) It has also been applied to employment disputes involving civil servants who had lost a remote-area allowance which had been added to their salaries as a bonus (see Vilho Eskelinen, cited above, §§ 40 and 41) or who had been transferred to another office or post against their will, resulting in a decrease in salary (see Zalli v. Albania, no. 52531/07, 8 February 2011, and Ohneberg v. Austria, no. 10781/08, 18 September 2012). Furthermore, in Bayer v. Germany (no. 8453/04, 16 July 2009), which concerned the removal from office of a State-employed bailiff following disciplinary proceedings, the Court held that disputes about ﬁsalaries, allowances or similar entitlementsﬂ were only non-exhaustive examples of ﬁordinary labour disputesﬂ to which Article 6 should in principle apply under the Vilho Eskelinen test (ibid., § 38; see also Regner, cited above, § 108).63.  The Court further notes that the criteria set out in Vilho Eskelinen and Others have been applied to all types of disputes concerning civil servants and judges, including in respect of their recruitment or appointment (see  v. Croatia, no. 58222/09, 26 July 2011), career or promotion (see Dzhidzheva-Trendafilova (dec.), no. 12628/09, 9 October 2012),  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT30transfer (see Ohneberg, cited above, § 25), and termination of service (see  v. Croatia, no. 22330/05, § 67, 5 February 2009, concerning the disciplinary dismissal of the President of the Supreme Court, and Nazsiz (dec.), no. 22412/05, 26 May 2009, concerning the disciplinary dismissal of a prosecutor).(b)Application of above-mentioned principles to the present case(i)Existence of a right64.  The Court notes that there was undoubtedly a ﬁdisputeﬂ (contestation) in the present case: the proceedings at issue concerned accusations about a breach of professional duty brought against the applicant in the disciplinary proceedings before the HSYK. This dispute was one of a real and serious nature and the proceedings that followed were decisive for the applicant™s rights: these proceedings could have had serious repercussions for the applicant, such as his dismissal.65.  The Court is not persuaded by the Government™s argument that the civil limb of Article 6 § 1 is not applicable for the sole reason that the applicant™s dispute falls within the field of public law and there is no ﬁcivilﬂ right at stake. A public-law dispute may bring the civil limb into play if the private-law aspects predominate over the public-law ones in view of the direct consequences for a civil pecuniary or non-pecuniary right (see Denisov, cited above, § 53). Admittedly, in the present case, the proceedings in question concerned a disciplinary measure. The dispute did not concern a question relating to ﬁsalaries, allowances or similar entitlementsﬂ, which are, however, only non-exhaustive examples of the ﬁordinary labour disputesﬂ to which Article 6 of the Convention should in principle apply (see Bayer, cited above, § 38). The Court nevertheless finds that Article 6 also applies in the present case Œ subject to the application of the criteria identified in the Vilho Eskelinen and Others judgment Œ for the reasons set out below.66.  The Court observes that the applicant, who was first a prosecutor at the Court of Cassation and later served as a judge in Istanbul, was subjected to disciplinary proceedings in respect of numerous and substantial accusations. As a result of these proceedings, some of the accusations were upheld and a disciplinary sanction was imposed on him on the grounds that, by his statements to the media, he had undermined the dignity and honour of the profession and had forfeited dignity and personal esteem. The measure in question is the harshest sanction after dismissal. The disciplinary proceedings against the applicant could have resulted in various sanctions ranging from a simple warning to suspension, or even dismissal. In particular, the main accusation against the applicant, namely that he had ﬁundermined the honour and dignityﬂ of the judicial profession, could also have entailed the sanction of dismissal (see paragraph 39 above). This  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT31means that dismissal, as a sanction potentially applicable to the applicant, was certainly a possible outcome. Consequently, the disciplinary proceedings directly called into question the applicant™s right to continue exercising his profession (contrast  v. Croatia (dec.), no. 79821/12, §§ 74-75, 23 May 2017). The Court reiterates in this connection that disciplinary proceedings concerning the right to continue practising a profession are always regarded as involving ﬁdispute as to rights ... of a civil natureﬂ within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Di Giovanni v. Italy, no. 51160/06, § 36, 9 July 2013, and the references cited therein). In this connection, it would point out that in the Di Giovanni case (cited above), in which a judge had been given a mere warning, it concluded that the dispute had been one of a civil nature.67. The Court further observes that the measure at issue in the present case concerned the applicant™s place of employment; while he was serving as a judge in Istanbul, he had been transferred prematurely to another judicial district, in  As pointed out above (see paragraph 62), Article 6 has been applied to employment disputes concerning civil servants who had been deprived of a remote-area allowance which had been added to their salaries, or who had been transferred to another office or post against their will, resulting in a reduction in their salary.68.  Moreover, it is apparent from the Government™s observations (see paragraph 56 above) that the impugned measure also affected the applicant™s remuneration as a judge/prosecutor (compare Denisov, cited above, § 54). Indeed, as a result of the disciplinary sanction in question, the applicant had forfeited the requisite qualification for classification in the first grade. As a result, he was unable to benefit from the 2% increase which was due to judges and prosecutors every three years. Admittedly, following the replacement of this sanction by a reprimand in 2015, he regained the said qualification. However, it has not been established that the softening of the sanction enabled the applicant, who had already left the judiciary in 2015, to obtain this increase retroactively.(ii)ﬁCivilﬂ nature of the right: the Vilho Eskelinen test69.  Applying the Vilho Eskelinen test further (see, in the same vein, Denisov, § 55), the Court reiterates that, for the first of those conditions to be met, the respondent State must have expressly provided in its domestic law for exclusion from access to a court for the post or wage group concerned.70.  As regards the first condition of the Eskelinen test, that is to say whether national law ﬁexpressly excludedﬂ access to a court for the post or category of staff in question, the Court notes that in the few cases in which it has found that condition to be fulfilled, the exclusion from access to a court for the post in question was provided for clearly and expressly (see examples cited in Kövesi v. Romania, no. 3594/19, § 119, 5 May 2020). v. TURKEY JUDGMENT3271.  The Court would point out that, under Turkish law at the relevant time, in accordance with Article 159 § 10 of the Constitution, ﬁno appeal [lay] against decisions of the Council before the ordinary courtsﬂ. However, since the constitutional reform of 2010 there has been a right of appeal against the sanction of dismissal imposed by the HSYK (see paragraph 38 above). Accordingly, it can no longer be claimed that the disciplinary procedure concerning judges and prosecutors in Turkey, since the above-mentioned constitutional reform, is completely excluded from any judicial review. In particular, it is noteworthy that exclusion from access to a court is not linked to a post or category of employee but to the severity of the disciplinary sanction. It follows that judges and prosecutors dismissed from office following disciplinary proceedings are thus able to seek judicial review of the measure in question before the domestic courts. Consequently, the Court considers that the present case should be distinguished from the cases cited in Kövesi (cited above, § 119). However, it does not find it necessary to decide whether the first condition of the Eskelinen test is fulfilled in the present case. Indeed, it observes that, even if Œ leaving aside the specific regime applicable to dismissals, which are subject to judicial review Œ the national normative framework had expressly deprived the applicant of a right of access to a court in respect of the sanction at issue, the inapplicability of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention could not, in any event, be justified on objective grounds in the State™s interest.72.  The Court reiterates that the mere fact that the applicant is in a sector or department which participates in the exercise of power conferred by public law is not in itself decisive. In order for the exclusion to be justified, it is not enough for the State to establish that the civil servant in question participates in the exercise of public power or that there exists, to use the words of the Court in Pellegrin v. France ([GC], no. 28541/95, § 65, ECHR 1999-VIII), a ﬁspecial bond of trust and loyaltyﬂ between the civil servant and the State, as employer. It is also for the State to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue is related to the exercise of State power or that it has called into question the special bond.73.  The Court takes note of the Government™s argument in this connection. In order to justify the exclusion in question, the Government maintained that the subject-matter of the dispute was the exercise of the profession of judge/prosecutor and that the justice system was not an ordinary public service in so far as it was one of the essential manifestations of sovereignty. In their view, by its nature, the office of judge/prosecutor involves the exercise of powers inherent in the sovereignty of the State and therefore relates directly to the exercise of public authority. In that connection, the Government referred in particular to the Pitkevich v. Russia ((dec.), no. 47936/99, 8 February 2001) and Serdal Apay (cited above) decisions. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT3374.  The Court would point out that, in the Turkish cases related to members of the judicial professions (see Serdal Apay and Nazsiz, decisions cited above), it certainly found that the removal from the scope of Article 6 of the Convention of disputes concerning public prosecutors was justified on State interest grounds. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied on the Pitkevich precedent (cited above) dating from 2001 (prior to Vilho Eskelinen and Others), which excluded the judicial professions from the scope of Article 6 in accordance with the Pellegrin case-law. Similarly, in the case of  (cited above, § 30), in which the Court dealt with the case of a female judge who had been dismissed from her post following disciplinary proceedings, it relied on the Serdal Apay precedent (cited above), and noted that the position of judge in principle precluded the applicability of Article 6 in the light of the principles set out in the Vilho Eskelinen and Others judgment (cited above). It decided, however, to recharacterise the complaint by examining it under Article 13 in conjunction with Article 8, without giving a final ruling on the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention.75.  That being said, it should be borne in mind that under the legislation applicable at the material time in the cases which gave rise to the above-mentioned decisions and judgments, Turkey had categorically excluded access to a court for all kinds of disciplinary measures against judges and prosecutors. However, that legislation has changed since the constitutional reform of 2010.76.  More importantly, in its recent case-law, the Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties (see Baka, cited above, § 164, and the references cited therein). This consideration applies with equal relevance to disciplinary proceedings affecting the careers of judges. Given the prominent place among State organs that judges and prosecutors hold in a democratic society, together with the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the justice system (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, § 196), the Court must pay particular attention to the protection of judges when it is called upon to review disciplinary proceedings against them in the light of the Convention provisions.Such considerations may also apply mutatis mutandis to prosecutors in Turkey, in so far as the Turkish judicial system does not make any fundamental distinction between the status of judges and prosecutors (see paragraph 36 above, and, mutatis mutandis, Kövesi, cited above, § 124).77.  In this connection, since the Vilho Eskelinen and Others judgment (cited above) the Court has had to deal with only a few cases requiring examination of the second condition of the test set out therein: Suküt  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT34v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 59773/00, 11 September 2007), where the case concerned the early retirement of a member of the armed forces for disciplinary reasons; and  and  v. Latvia ((dec.), nos. 2631/10 and 12253/10, 18 November 2014), which concerned the withdrawal of security clearance from one applicant, who had been entrusted with intelligence and counter-espionage, and from another applicant, who held one of the highest positions in the State Revenue Service and was in charge of the Customs Criminal Investigation Department. In these cases, the Court held that the exclusion from access to a court was justified because the subject matter of the disputes was related to the exercise of governmental authority or called into question the ﬁspecial bond of trust and loyaltyﬂ between the individual concerned and the State as employer.78.  The Court finds that the above-mentioned case-law, which concerned an army officer and senior civil servants, all hierarchically attached to the executive branch of the State, cannot be transposed to the circumstances of the present case, which concerns a member of the judiciary. In the Court™s view, the criterion that the subject-matter of the dispute must relate to the calling into question of the special bond of trust and loyalty must be read in the light of the guarantees of the independence of the judiciary. These two notions, namely the special bond of trust and loyalty required from civil servants and the independence of the judiciary cannot be easily reconciled. While the employment relationship between a civil servant and the State can traditionally be defined on the basis of trust and loyalty vis-à-vis the executive branch of government in so far as State employees are required to implement government policies, members of the judiciary enjoy specific guarantees which are considered essential to the exercise of judicial authority and they are bound by the duty, inter alia, to review acts of government. The complex nature of the working relationship between members of the judiciary and the State requires that the judiciary be sufficiently distant from other branches of the State in the exercise of its powers so as to enable its members to make decisions which are based to a greater extent on the requirements of law and justice, without fear or favour. It would be illusory to believe that members of the judiciary can uphold the rule of law and give effect to that principle if they are deprived by domestic law of Convention protection in relation to matters directly affecting their independence and impartiality (see Kövesi, cited above, § 124).79.  Furthermore, in the present case, it should be noted that, at the end of the disciplinary proceedings in question, the applicant was punished by the HSYK for statements he had made to the media. The subject-matter of the dispute was therefore essentially whether those statements were compatible with the applicant™s duty of discretion, given his position at the time. Admittedly, this is a question which requires the weighing in the balance of the various interests at stake. However, in the light of the reasons given for  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT35the HSYK™s decisions, the Court has not identified any aspect of the subject-matter of the dispute which could give rise to ﬁobjective grounds in the State™s interestﬂ within the meaning of the Vilho Eskelinen and Others judgment (cited above), or grounds related to the exercise of governmental authority.80.  Accordingly, assuming that the first condition of the Vilho Eskelinen and Others test is not fulfilled, the Court takes the view that the Government is not in a position to demonstrate that the exclusion from access to a court was justified on grounds in the State™s interest or that the subject-matter of the dispute was connected with the exercise of governmental authority, or called into question the ﬁspecial bond of trust and loyaltyﬂ between the applicant and the State as employer. Given the special status of members of the judicial professions and the importance of judicial review of disciplinary proceedings concerning them, the Court finds that it cannot be said that a special bond of trust between the State and the applicant justified excluding the rights guaranteed by the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Savino and Others v. Italy, nos. 17214/05 and 2 others, § 78, 28 April 2009).Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is thus applicable in the light of the second condition of the test laid down in the Vilho Eskelinen and Others judgment (cited above).(c) Conclusion81.  It is thus appropriate to reject the preliminary objection raised by the Government as to the inapplicability of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.82.  The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.B.Merits1.The parties™ submissions83.  In his application form, the applicant submitted that the HSYK, which had imposed the sanction on him, could not be regarded as an objective, independent and impartial body complying with the principle of fairness.First, he complained of a violation of his right to a court. He claimed to have sustained the violation on account of the lack of judicial review of decisions imposing disciplinary sanctions, with the exception of the sanction of dismissal. He pointed out that, although such decisions were likely to have serious and irreversible consequences for the professional life of judges and prosecutors, they fell outside the scope of judicial review pursuant to Article 159 of the Constitution. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT36Secondly, the applicant criticised the alleged influence of the executive on the HSYK. This was demonstrated in his view by the fact that the Minister of Justice and the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, who belonged to the executive branch of government, were members of this body. Furthermore, he drew the Court™s attention to the fact that the Minister of Justice chaired the HSYK and played a key role in bringing disciplinary proceedings against judges and prosecutors.Thirdly, the applicant criticised some of the members of the Second Chamber of the HSYK, which had decided on the impugned disciplinary sanction issued on 19 July 2011, for also having sat in the Plenary Assembly of the HSYK which had heard his appeal. In his view, these members had already made known their position on the merits of the case and could not therefore be impartial.Fourthly, the applicant complained of a lack of reasoning in the decisions delivered in his case.84.  In his rejoinder, the applicant argued, inter alia, that at the material time the HSYK had been largely dominated by members of an organisation designated by the Turkish authorities as ﬁFETÖ/PDYﬂ (ﬁFethullahist Terrorist Organisation / Parallel State Structureﬂ) and that they had used the disciplinary proceedings to intimidate him.85.  The Government disputed the applicant™s arguments. They submitted that the HSYK was primarily an administrative body and it therefore exercised powers in matters of administration and inspection of the judiciary, enabling it to take binding decisions of an administrative nature. They added, however, that the HSYK could not be regarded as a completely administrative body within the State apparatus. According to the Government it was a constitutional body established and operating in accordance with the principle of the independence of the courts and the guarantees enjoyed by judges and prosecutors under Article 159 of the Constitution.86.  At the material time the HSYK had been composed of twenty-two full members and twelve substitute members. The Government gave the following additional information on its composition at that time: the Minister of Justice was the Chair of the HSYK and the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Justice was an ex officio member; four full members, whose qualifications were laid down by law, were appointed by the President of the Republic from among members of the teaching staff in the field of law and lawyers; three full members and three substitute members were elected by the general assembly of the Court of Cassation from among the members of that court; two full members and two substitute members were elected by the general assembly of the Supreme Administrative Court from among the members of that court; one full member and one substitute member were elected by the general assembly of the Turkish Academy of Justice from among the members of that institution; seven full members and four  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT37substitute members were elected by judges and prosecutors of the ordinary courts from among the first- grade judges still eligible; three full members and two substitute members were elected by the administrative court judges and prosecutors from among the first-grade judges still eligible. The Government added that, at the material time, the two ex officio members of the HSYK (the Minister of Justice and the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Justice) came from the executive and the members enjoying the security of judicial tenure were in the majority; the term of office of the members of the HSYK was four years; and the establishment, status and powers of the Council were governed by the Constitution and the applicable law in such matters.87.  The Government pointed out that the independence of the members thus chosen to make up the HSYK was guaranteed by the Constitution and the relevant legislation and that nothing, whether in the appointment of those members or in the functioning of the Council, could undermine that independence.88.  As regards the appeal proceedings, the Government submitted that they had been conducted in accordance with the applicable legislation, namely section 33 of Law no. 6087, as in force at the material time. They stated that there was no evidence in the present case to suggest that the members of the HSYK had not been independent or impartial.2.The Court™s assessment(a)Relevant principles on the right to an independent and impartial tribunal89.  The Court reiterates that the right to a fair hearing must be construed in the light of the rule of law, which requires that all litigants should have an effective judicial remedy enabling them to assert their civil rights. Everyone has the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way, Article 6 § 1 embodies the ﬁright to a courtﬂ, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only (see, among other authorities, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 36, Series A no. 18; Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc. v. Switzerland [GC], no. 5809/08, § 126, 21 June 2016; and Naït-Liman v. Switzerland [GC], no. 51357/07, § 113, 15 March 2018).90.  The Court further observes that an authority which is not classified as one of the courts of a given State may nevertheless, for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, fall within the concept of a ﬁtribunalﬂ in the substantive sense of this expression (see Sramek v. Austria, no. 8790/79, § 36, 22 October 1984). A court or tribunal is characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say determining matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law, with full jurisdiction, and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner (ibid., and see Cyprus  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT38v. Turkey [GC], no. 25781/94, § 233, ECHR 2001-IV). A power of decision is inherent in the very notion of ﬁtribunalﬂ within the meaning of the Convention. The proceedings must provide the ﬁdetermination by a tribunal of the matters in disputeﬂ, as required by Article 6 (see Benthem v. the Netherlands, 23 October 1985, § 40, Series A no. 97). For the purposes of Article 6 § 1 a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated within the standard judicial machinery. It may be set up to deal with a specific subject matter which can be appropriately administered outside the ordinary court system (see Rolf Gustafson v. Sweden, 1 July 1997, § 45, Reports 1997-IV). Moreover, only an institution that has full jurisdiction and satisfies a number of requirements, such as independence of the executive and also of the parties, merits the designation ﬁtribunalﬂ within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (see Beaumartin v. France, 24 November 1994, § 38, Series A no. 296-B, and Di Giovanni, cited above, § 52).91.  Lastly, the Court would refer to the general principles on the requirements of an ﬁindependent and impartial tribunalﬂ at the stages of the determination and review of a case, as described in Denisov (cited above, §§ 60-65; with regard to the concept of a ﬁtribunal established by law ﬁ, see Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson v. Iceland [GC], no. 26374/18, §§ 218-234, 1 December 2020).(b)The approach to be adopted for the examination of the applicant™s complaints92.  The Court notes that in the present case, following the investigation conducted by the judicial inspectors on 30 October 2009, the Minister of Justice authorised the bringing of disciplinary proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 10 above). Subsequently, on 19 July 2011, the HSYK decided to impose on the applicant the sanction of disciplinary transfer (see paragraphs 13-14 above). This sanction was confirmed by the HSYK Plenary Assembly, which decided, however, not to uphold certain accusations against the applicant (see paragraph 18 above). The disciplinary sanction, having thus become final, was enforced and the applicant was transferred to a new posting (see paragraph 19 above). On 15 April 2015, following the entry into force of Law no. 6572, the HSYK re-examined the disciplinary sanction imposed on the applicant and decided to replace it with a reprimand, but without amending the accusations against him (see paragraph 25 above). As a result, the applicant was disciplined on account of statements he had made on various occasions.93.  The Court notes at the outset that the applicant submitted, under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, that there had been no judicial review of the disciplinary proceedings and that this breached his right of access to a court. He further argued that the proceedings before the HSYK relating to the disciplinary sanction at issue were not compatible with the requirements of  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT39independence and impartiality. Lastly, he complained of a lack of reasoning in the decisions in his case.94.  The Court observes that some of the complaints raised before it concern the composition of the HSYK and the lack of judicial review of its decisions. In fact the HSYK is not considered in the Turkish legal order to be a ﬁtribunalﬂ: it is a constitutional body, exercising its powers in accordance with the principle of the independence of the courts and the guarantees enjoyed by the judiciary under Article 159 of the Constitution.The Court reiterates that neither Article 6 § 1 nor any other provision of the Convention obliges States and their institutions to comply with a given judicial order. In this connection, it reiterates its case-law to the effect that the word ﬁtribunalﬂ in Article 6 § 1 is not necessarily to be understood as signifying a court of law of the classic kind, integrated within the standard judicial machinery of the country (see Savino and Others, cited above, § 91). Moreover, there is no question of imposing on the States a given constitutional model regulating in one way or another the relationship and interaction between the various State powers. Consequently, in its analysis the Court must first consider whether the HSYK, the body responsible for imposing disciplinary sanctions, can be regarded as a ﬁtribunalﬂ in the substantive sense by virtue of its judicial role: determining matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law, with full jurisdiction, and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner (see Sramek, cited above, § 36, and Cyprus v. Turkey, cited above, § 233), irrespective of its status under Turkish law. If the answer to that question is in the negative, the next question is whether the applicant had the opportunity to refer the disciplinary measure, imposed by a body that did not itself meet the requirements of a ﬁtribunalﬂ, for review by another body that met the requirements of Article 6 (see, for example, Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, § 132). Only in this way will the Court be able to deal with the substance of the applicant™s main complaint concerning the right to a court.(i)Respect for the principle that a case must be examined by a ﬁtribunalﬂ95.  The Court observes that the applicant™s complaint, formulated not only under Article 6 but also under Article 13, mainly concerns an alleged infringement of his right to a court. It is therefore necessary to examine the whole of the proceedings leading to the imposition of a disciplinary sanction on the applicant in order to address the question whether he had the opportunity to submit the disciplinary measure at issue to a ﬁtribunalﬂ meeting the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.96.  In the present case, it must first be ascertained whether the Second Chamber of the HSYK, when hearing the applicant™s case, could be regarded as meeting the requirements of a ﬁtribunalﬂ within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention. To this end, the Court will consider whether the  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT40disciplinary authority exercised a judicial function and examine the nature of the proceedings before that authority.97.  The Court would emphasise that disciplinary measures may have serious consequences for the lives and careers of the member of judiciary concerned, such as the applicant in the present case, who was accused of acts that rendered him liable for dismissal, that is to say, for very serious sanctions which carried a significant degree of stigma (see, mutatis mutandis, Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, § 196). The judicial review carried out must be appropriate to the subject-matter of the dispute, that is to say, in the instant case, to the disciplinary nature of the administrative decisions in question. This consideration applies with even greater force to disciplinary proceedings against judges and prosecutors, who must enjoy the respect that is necessary for the performance of their duties. When a member State brings such disciplinary proceedings, public confidence in the functioning and independence of the judiciary is at stake; in a democratic State, this confidence guarantees the very existence of the rule of law (ibid.).98.  In the present case, the Court finds that the disciplinary sanction at issue was imposed on the applicant by the Second Chamber of the HSYK and was subsequently confirmed by the Plenary Assembly of that Council. According to the Government, the HSYK is an administrative body which, moreover, enjoys a sui generis status: it is a constitutional body exercising its duties in accordance with the principle of the independence of the courts and the guarantees enjoyed by members of judiciary under Article 159 of the Constitution.99.  The Court thus notes, as the Government stated, that at the material time the HSYK, which was composed for the most part of judges or prosecutors, exercised its duties in accordance with the principle of the independence of the courts and the guarantees afforded to judges and prosecutors. Moreover, there is no doubt that this body had exclusive competence and decision-making power in matters relating to the organisation of the judiciary, the careers of judges and prosecutors, as well as the disciplinary proceedings. However, the Court agrees with the Government™s argument that the HSYK is a non-judicial body. Thus, as in the case of  (cited above), it is difficult to find, in the present case, when the applicant faced very severe sanctions, that the proceedings before the Second Chamber of the HSYK complied with the requirements of the procedural safeguards under Article 6 of the Convention: they were in fact mainly written proceedings and afforded very few safeguards to the judge/prosecutor concerned (ibid., § 77). In this connection, the Court observes that the relevant legislation did not contain any specific rules on the procedure to be followed, on the safeguards afforded to judges and prosecutors before the HSYK, or on the manner in which evidence was to be admitted and assessed. Moreover, the Second Chamber of the HSYK did  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT41not hold hearings, nor did it summon or hear witnesses. Lastly, the decisions handed down by this Chamber contained only rudimentary reasoning, giving no indication of the grounds which led it to rule as it did.100.  Having answered in the negative the question of whether the Second Chamber of the HSYK could be regarded as meeting the requirement of a ﬁtribunalﬂ, it is therefore appropriate to consider whether the applicant had the opportunity to refer the disciplinary measure for review by another body that met the requirements of Article 6.101.  The Court observes that the decisions of the Second Chamber of the HSYK, which hears disciplinary cases, could be challenged by way of an appeal lodged with the Plenary Assembly. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this body, which was responsible for reviewing the decision of the Second Chamber, afforded the guarantees of a judicial review. It is sufficient to recall the finding above as to the lack of procedural safeguards before the Second Chamber of the HSYK; this finding is also valid for the Plenary Assembly.102.  It follows, therefore, that neither the Second Chamber nor the Plenary Assembly of the HSYK can be characterised as a ﬁtribunalﬂ within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.103.  In this connection the Court reiterates its settled case-law according to which, even where an administrative body determining disputes over ﬁcivil rights and obligationsﬂ does not comply with Article 6 § 1 in some respect, no violation of the Convention can be found if the proceedings before that body are ﬁsubject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of Article 6 § 1ﬂ (see Albert and Le Compte, cited above, § 29, and Tsfayo v. the United Kingdom, no. 60860/00, § 42, 14 November 2006), that is, if any structural or procedural shortcomings identified in the proceedings before an administrative authority are remedied in the course of the subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction (see, Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, § 132, with further references). That is not the case here. The Government have not put forward any grounds which could justify excluding the disciplinary sanction in question from any judicial review.104.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the impugned sanction imposed on the applicant by the competent disciplinary authority has not been reviewed by another body exercising judicial functions or by an ordinary court. In these circumstances, it takes the view that the respondent State has impaired the very essence of the applicant™s right of access to a court.105.  Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the breach of the principle that a case must be examined by a tribunal established by law. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT42(ii)Other complaints under Article 6106.  The applicant argued that the proceedings in the HSYK concerning the impugned disciplinary sanction had not been compatible with the requirements of independence and impartiality. He further complained about the lack of reasoning of the decisions given in his case.107.  The Government disputed this argument.108.  Having regard to the foregoing and in view of the Court™s findings under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention it does not find any separate issue to be addressed in these complaints. Therefore there is no need to examine them separately.III.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION109.  The applicant alleged that there had been a breach of his right to freedom of expression on account of the disciplinary sanction imposed on him. He relied on Article 10 of the Convention, of which the relevant par reads as follows:ﬁ1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...2.  The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or sanctions as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.ﬂA.Admissibility110.  The Court finds that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B.Merits1.The parties™ submissions(a)The applicant111.  In his application form the applicant argued that the opening of disciplinary proceedings against him on account of statements he had made on various occasions constituted a breach of his right to freedom of expression. He submitted that in the impugned statements he was merely  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT43defending, in his capacity as chair of Yarsav, an association of judges and prosecutors, the rule of law and the independence of the justice system.(b)The Government112.  The Government argued that the disciplinary sanction had been based on section 68(a) of Law no. 2802. The applicant, in his capacity as Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, could reasonably have foreseen that his offending remarks, made on different occasions, could entail disciplinary sanctions.113.  They further submitted that the disciplinary sanction had been imposed on the applicant for the purpose of maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary within the meaning of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.114.  Referring to the Court™s case-law, the Government stated that members of the judiciary had to act in accordance with their duty of discretion and avoid any doubt as to their impartiality, on account of the nature of their public office.115.  The Government contended that the present case differed from the Baka case (cited above). In that case, the applicant had given his opinion on the legislative reforms at issue in his professional capacity as President of the Supreme Court and of the National Council of Justice. In the present case, however, the applicant™s statements which had given rise to the disciplinary sanction had not concerned the position held by the applicant at the time of the events, namely that of prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. They therefore argued that the applicant had not been acting with the privilege deriving from his position as Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. They added that the statements in question had been made by the applicant in his capacity as chair of Yarsav, an association of judges and prosecutors. According to the Government, however, those statements had not been consonant with the aims of Yarsav, since the latter defined itself in its rules as a supra-political non-governmental organisation (NGO) set up to defend the independence and impartiality of the courts and the rule of law.116.  Furthermore, the Government drew the Court™s attention to the importance of the applicant™s position as prosecutor at the Court of Cassation. This position had given the applicant a prominent role within the justice system. Consequently, he should have exercised caution in expressing his thoughts and opinions. In the Government™s view, it had been the applicant™s duty, as a senior judicial officer, to exercise his freedom of expression with restraint, in so far as his statements were liable to undermine not only his own impartiality but also the impartiality of the judicial body to which he belonged.117.  The Government submitted that the applicant had not complied with the above-mentioned duty of discretion. They referred to some of the  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT44misdeeds and statements that the HSYK took into consideration Œ as referred to at various points in the decision of 19 July 2011 Œ in imposing the disciplinary sanction on the applicant: those referred to in paragraph 4 (iii) (at a meeting the applicant had mentioned the names of murdered judges and had criticised the constitutional reform); those referred to in paragraph 2 (c) (statements in which the applicant had criticised the criminal investigation against a journalist, M.B., accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation); those referred to in paragraph 2 (e) (statements in which the applicant had criticised the measures taken against I.S., another journalist facing the same charges as M.B.); those referred to in paragraph 2 (g) (statements by the applicant in which he had said: ﬁNow it has turned into an attack on science; they have started throwing a ‚grenade™ at the judiciary and science; we will not let anyone throw such grenadesﬂ); those referred to in paragraph 3 (h) (concerning a visit by the applicant to S.K., former public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation); and those referred to in paragraph 2 (h) (at a meeting the applicant had criticised the investigation into the ﬁErgenekonﬂ organisation).118.  The Government maintained that the applicant™s speeches had resembled political rhetoric, expressed on various occasions. They added that some of the statements in issue concerned ongoing judicial proceedings. In their view, the applicant had thus acted in breach of his duty of discretion and had shown that he could no longer exercise his profession as judge/prosecutor in an impartial manner. Consequently, the applicant™s statements had clearly impaired the dignity and prestige of judicial office.119.  Accordingly, the Government submitted that the disputed measure had met a compelling social need and had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, namely to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.2.The Court™s assessment(a)General principles120.  The Court reiterates that the protection of Article 10 of the Convention extends to the workplace in general and to civil servants in particular (see Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, § 53, Series A no. 323). While the Court has admitted that it is legitimate for a State to impose on civil servants, on account of their status, a duty of discretion, civil servants are individuals and, as such, qualify for the protection of Article 10 of the Convention (ibid., and see Guja v. Moldova [GC], no. 14277/04, § 70, ECHR 2008). It therefore falls to the Court, having regard to the circumstances of each case, to determine whether a fair balance has been struck between the fundamental right of the individual to freedom of expression and the legitimate interest of a democratic State in ensuring that its civil service properly furthers the purposes enumerated in  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT45Article 10 § 2. In carrying out this review, the Court will bear in mind that whenever a civil servant™s right to freedom of expression is in issue the ﬁduties and responsibilitiesﬂ referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance, which justifies leaving to the national authorities a certain margin of appreciation in determining whether the impugned interference is proportionate to the above aim (see Baka, cited above, § 162, and the references cited therein).121.  The Court further reiterates that, given the prominent place among State organs that the judiciary occupies in a democratic society, this approach also applies in the event of restrictions on the freedom of expression of a judge in connection with the performance of his or her functions, albeit the judiciary is not part of the ordinary civil service (see Albayrak v. Turkey, no. 38406/97, § 42, 31 January 2008, and Pitkevich, decision cited above). The Court has recognised that it can be expected of public officials serving in the judiciary that they should show restraint in exercising their freedom of expression in all cases where the authority and impartiality of the judiciary are likely to be called in question (see Baka, cited above, § 164).122.  The Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary, which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a law-governed State, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties. It is for this reason that judicial authorities, in so far as the exercise of their adjudicatory function is concerned, are required to exercise maximum discretion with regard to the cases with which they deal in order to preserve their image as impartial judges (, cited above, § 59). It may therefore prove necessary to protect such confidence against destructive attacks that are essentially unfounded, especially in view of the fact that judges who have been criticised are subject to a duty of discretion that precludes them from replying (see Prager and Oberschlick v. Austria, 26 April 1995, § 34, Series A no. 313).123.  At the same time, the Court has also stressed, in cases concerning judges who have been in a similar situation to that of the present applicant, that having regard in particular to the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and the importance of safeguarding the independence of the justice system, any interference with the freedom of expression of a judge in such a position calls for close scrutiny on the part of the Court. Furthermore, questions concerning the functioning of the justice system fall within the public interest, the debate of which generally enjoys a high degree of protection under Article 10. Even if an issue under debate has political implications, this is not in itself sufficient to prevent a judge from making a statement on the matter. Issues relating to the separation of powers can involve very important matters in a democratic society which the public  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT46has a legitimate interest in being informed about and which fall within the scope of political debate (see Baka, cited above, § 165).124.  Moreover, the Court reiterates the ﬁchilling effectﬂ that the fear of sanction has on the exercise of freedom of expression, in particular on other judges wishing to participate in the public debate on issues related to the administration of justice and the courts (see Kudeshkina, no. 29492/05, §§ 99-100, 26 February 2009). This effect, which works to the detriment of society as a whole, is also a factor that concerns the proportionality of the sanction or punitive measure imposed (ibid., § 99).125.  As mentioned above (see paragraphs 35 and 75 above), these considerations may also apply mutatis mutandis to prosecutors in Turkey, as the Turkish judicial system does not make any fundamental distinction between the status of judges and prosecutors.126.  Lastly, in order to assess the justification of an impugned measure, it must be borne in mind that the fairness of proceedings and the existence of procedural safeguards are factors to be taken into account when assessing the proportionality of an interference with the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 (see, mutatis mutandis, Castells v. Spain, 23 April 1992, §§ 47-48, Series A no. 236; Association Ekin v. France, no. 39288/98, § 61, ECHR 2001-VIII; Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51279/99, § 66, ECHR 2002-V; Steel and Morris v. the United Kingdom, no. 68416/01, § 95, ECHR 2005-II; Kyprianou v. Cyprus [GC], no. 73797/01, §§ 171 and 181, ECHR 2005-XIII; Mamère v. France, no. 12697/03, §§ 23-24, ECHR 2006-XIII; Kudeshkina, cited above, § 83; and Morice v. France [GC], no. 29369/10, § 155, ECHR 2015). The Court has already found that the absence of an effective judicial review may support the finding of a violation of Article 10 (see, in particular, Lombardi Vallauri v. Italy, no. 39128/05, §§ 45-56, 20 October 2009). Indeed, as the Court has previously held in the context of Article 10, ﬁ[t]he quality of ... judicial review of the necessity of the measure is of particular importance in this respect, including to the operation of the relevant margin of appreciationﬂ (see Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08 § 108, ECHR 2013).(b)Application of those principles to the present case(i)Whether there was an interference127.  As to the extent of the interference, the Court observes that the disciplinary sanction imposed on the applicant was not directly linked to his professional conduct in the justice system. In addition, the disciplinary offence of which he was found guilty concerned statements and opinions for which he had been reproached. Accordingly, the measure complained of essentially related to freedom of expression, and not the holding of a public post in the administration of justice, the right to which is not secured by the  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT47Convention (see Kudeshkina, cited above, § 79). It follows that Article 10 is applicable in the present case.The Court finds that it is not in dispute between the parties that the disciplinary sanction imposed on the applicant constituted an interference with the exercise of the right protected by Article 10 of the Convention. It will therefore examine whether that measure was justified in the light of Article 10 § 2 of the Convention.(ii)Whether the interference was lawful128.  The Government stated that the impugned measure was based on section 68(2)(a) of Law no. 2802 and that, consequently, the interference was prescribed by law. The applicant did not submit any observations on that point.129.  The Court reiterates that the expression ﬁprescribed by lawﬂ, within the meaning of Article 10 § 2, requires that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law, but it also refers to the quality of the law in question, requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences, and that it should be compatible with the rule of law. Whether the first condition is met in the present case is not a matter of dispute. Indeed, it is not contested that the interference at issue Œ in the present case, the disciplinary investigation and the resulting disciplinary sanction Œ had a legal basis, namely section 68(2)(a) of Law no. 2802.It remains to be ascertained whether the legal rule in question also met the requirements of accessibility and foreseeability. The Court reiterates that the level of precision required of domestic legislation Œ which cannot in any case provide for every eventuality Œ depends to a considerable degree on the content of the instrument in question, the field it is designed to cover and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed. It is moreover primarily for the national authorities to interpret and apply domestic law (see Vogt, cited above, § 48).130.  In the present case, the Court observes at the outset that the terms used in section 68(2) (a) of Law no. 2802, such as ﬁdignityﬂ and ﬁhonour of the professionﬂ, and ﬁdignity and personal esteemﬂ are general and allow multiple interpretations. It should also be pointed out that the Government did not cite any case-law of the HSYK with regard to the definition of the concepts mentioned in that provision. However, with regard to the rules on the conduct of members of the judiciary, a reasonable approach should be taken in assessing statutory precision (see, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 178). Accordingly, the Court is prepared to proceed on the assumption that the impugned interference was prescribed by law. v. TURKEY JUDGMENT48(iii)Whether there was a legitimate aim131.  The Court observes that, in the present case, the Government justified the investigation and ensuing sanction mainly by the duty of reserve and discretion that is binding on judges and prosecutors.A certain number of Contracting States impose a duty of discretion on members of the civil service or judges and prosecutors. In the present case, the duty imposed on judges and prosecutors stemmed from the need to maintain their independence as well as the authority of their decisions. The Court thus finds that the resulting interference pursued at least one of the aims recognised as legitimate by the Convention, namely to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.(iv)Whether the interference was ﬁnecessary in a democratic societyﬂ132.  In order to assess whether the measure taken by the national authorities in response to the applicant™s actions met a ﬁpressing social needﬂ and was ﬁproportionate to the legitimate aim pursuedﬂ, the Court must look at the case as a whole. It will attach particular importance to the office held by the applicant Œ a prosecutor at the material time and later appointed as a judge Œ, his statements and the context in which they were made, together with the decision-making process which led to the measure in question.(1)The office held by the applicant133.  The Court observes that at the material time the applicant was a member of the public prosecutor™s office attached to the Court of Cassation. There can be no doubt that this specific status   which the applicant enjoyed in the national legal system   gave him a central role within the judicial professions in the administration of justice. That role imposed a duty on him to act as a guarantor of individual freedoms and the rule of law, through his contribution to the proper functioning of the justice system and thus to public confidence in that system (see Kayasu v. Turkey, nos. 64119/00 and 76292/01, § 91, 13 November 2008).134.  Moreover, it should be borne in mind that, at the material time, the applicant was also the chair of the association Yarsav, which defended the interests of members of the judicial professions and the principle of the rule of law. It should be pointed out that, in the proceedings before the HSYK, the applicant explained that he had made the disputed statements in his capacity as chair of that association. In this connection, the Court has accepted that when an NGO draws attention to matters of public interest, it is exercising a public watchdog role of similar importance to that of the press (see Animal Defenders International, cited above, § 103) and may be characterised as a social ﬁwatchdogﬂ warranting similar protection under the Convention as that afforded to the press (ibid.; and see Magyar Helsinki  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT49Bizottság v. Hungary [GC], no. 18030/11, § 166, 8 November 2016). It has recognised that civil society makes an important contribution to the discussion of public affairs (see, for instance, Steel and Morris, cited above, § 89, and Magyar Helsinki Bizottság, cited above, § 166). Consequently, the applicant had not only the right but also the duty, as chair of this legally established association, which continued to engage freely in its activities, to express an opinion on questions concerning the functioning of the justice system. As stated above (see paragraph 123), even if such issues have political implications, this is not in itself sufficient to prevent a judge from making a statement on the matter (see Baka, cited above, § 165).135.  Accordingly, the Court observes that, first, the applicant was bound by the duty of discretion inherent in his position as judge/prosecutor and that, secondly, as the chair of an association of judges and prosecutors, he had a role as a stakeholder in civil society. Thus his role and duties included expressing his views on the legislative reforms which were likely to have an impact on the courts and on judicial independence. It refers in this connection to the Council of Europe instruments, which recognise that each judge is responsible for promoting and protecting judicial independence and that judges and courts should be consulted and involved in the preparation of legislation concerning their profession and, more generally, the functioning of the justice system (see paragraph 45 above, and, as to the relevant international instruments, Baka, cited above, §§ 72-73 and 82-86).(2)The content of the offending statements136.  The Court notes that the applicant made a number of statements on various occasions about different matters. It reiterates that, in principle, the judicial authorities are required to exercise maximum discretion with regard to the cases with which they deal in order to preserve their image as impartial judges. That discretion should dissuade them from making use of the press, even when provoked. It is the higher demands of justice and the elevated nature of judicial office which impose that duty (see Poyraz v. Turkey, no. 15966/06, § 69, 7 December 2010). Judges must also show restraint when they express criticisms about their fellow civil servants, in particular other judges (see Di Giovanni, cited above, §§ 80-83, and  v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec.), no. 75255/10, 15 November 2016).137.  In the present case the HSYK decided to impose a disciplinary sanction on the applicant mainly for three series of statements, which are mentioned at different points of its decision of 19 July 2011. For the purposes of the present case it will examine those statements separately. It will not, however, take account of those referred to in point 3 (h) (concerning a visit paid by the applicant to S.K., former prosecutor at the Court of Cassation), even though the Government referred to them in their observations (see paragraph 117 above), since they were dismissed by the Plenary Assembly of the HSYK (see paragraph 18 above). v. TURKEY JUDGMENT50First series of statements138.  The Court observes that the first set of statements consisted mainly of criticisms of certain measures taken during the criminal investigation against the organisation known as ﬁErgenekonﬂ. It is apparent from the statements in question that the applicant was in particular questioning the manner in which those measures had been applied. During a visit to a daily newspaper, the applicant also criticised the manner in which the statement of one of its journalists had been taken (point 2 (c)). In his remarks made during a television programme, he pointed out the legal conditions for detention in police custody, citing the case of a 91-year-old person, and criticised statements made by politicians on an ongoing case (point 2 (d)). Similarly, in his statements of 23 March 2008 (point 2 (e)), he not only criticised the detention in police custody, in the middle of the night, of a journalist who, he said, was elderly and ill, but also denounced the pressure which he claimed was being exerted by politicians on an ongoing case. As regards, lastly, two statements that he made during a demonstration and a panel discussion could be seen more as a warning to the executive and as a defence of the independence of the judiciary.139.  The Court notes at the outset that the applicant™s criticisms were directed primarily against the preventive measures taken during the criminal investigation in a high-profile case, and not against the criminal proceedings as such. The reality of the measures criticised by the applicant was not disputed by the Government. Consequently, those criticisms had a factual basis and must therefore be regarded as findings of fact which, in the specific context, were indissociable from the opinions expressed by the applicant in his statements. It is important to note that he was a member of the public prosecutor™s office attached to the Court of Cassation and was serving as a public prosecutor. Having regard to his high-ranking status in the judicial professions, the Court must bear in mind that, whenever the right to freedom of expression of persons in such a position is at issue, the ﬁduties and responsibilitiesﬂ referred to in Article 10 § 2 assume a special significance since it can be expected of public officials serving in the judiciary that they should show restraint in exercising their freedom of expression in all cases where the authority and impartiality of the judiciary are likely to be called into question (see Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 64, ECHR 1999-VII). The Court reiterates that the duty of discretion on the part of members of judiciary requires that even authentic information be disclosed accurately and reliably (see Guja, cited above, § 75, and Wille, cited above, §§ 64 and 67). Accordingly, it must be examined whether the opinions expressed by the applicant on a factual basis were nevertheless excessive in view of his status as judge/prosecutor.140.  The Court observes that the applicant publicly criticised a high-profile pending criminal case. Admittedly, through his statements, the applicant was commenting on a worrying situation regarding the  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT51implementation of certain investigative measures. He also maintained that the judiciary was under pressure from the government (compare Kayasu, cited above, § 101). This was undoubtedly a matter of very significant public interest, which should be open to free debate in a democratic society (compare Kudeshkina, cited above, § 94). Moreover, the Court sees no reason to believe that the applicant was driven by a desire to derive personal benefit from his action, that he had a personal grievance, or that he was motivated by any other hidden agenda. It can therefore be accepted that the applicant™s comments were indeed prompted by the intentions that he indicated and that he was acting in good faith. However, even though the Court finds it significant that the applicant did not play any role in the conduct of the investigation or the prosecution in question, it should be borne in mind that his remarks also consisted in criticism of the judicial handling of an ongoing case. Seen from that perspective and having regard to the principles stemming from the duty of discretion on the part of members of judiciary (see paragraphs 120-21 above), it also attaches weight to the reasons put forward by the Government to justify the interference with the applicant™s right to freedom of expression, reasons which can be considered relevant to this series of statements.Second series of statements141.  As to the second series of statements, they related mainly to remarks made by the applicant on the various aspects of criminal proceedings brought against a Turkish journalist of Armenian origin (Mr Dink, murdered in 2007; see Dink v. Turkey, nos. 2668/07 and 4 others, 14 September 2010). In those statements, the applicant criticised the wording of Article 301 of the Criminal Code and the manner in which the above-mentioned case was dealt with by the domestic courts, stating that, in his capacity as public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, he was of the opinion that the offence of which the journalist was accused had not been committed (paragraph 3 (c-e)).142.  The Court observes that these statements were found by the HSYK to constitute a breach of the duty of impartiality. It should be noted, however, that the applicant™s remarks concerned a case that had already been decided. The applicant did indeed openly criticise Article 301 of the Criminal Code and the position taken by the national courts vis-à-vis criminal proceedings under that provision. However, it should be pointed out that cases relating to that provision have given rise to findings of a violation by the Court (see Dink, cited above, and  Taner Akçam v. Turkey, no. 27520/07, 25 October 2011). It is noteworthy that, in the  Taner Akçam judgment (cited above, § 95), the Court held, inter alia, that Article 301 of the Criminal Code did not meet the ﬁquality of lawﬂ requirement on the ground that its unacceptable terms, being too broad, resulted in a lack of foreseeability as to its effects. The Court therefore fails  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT52to see how the criticisms at issue can be regarded as an action or statement undermining the dignity of the applicant™s profession.143.  The present case also differs from other cases in which public confidence in the administration of justice and the need to protect that confidence from destructive attacks were at stake (see Di Giovanni, cited above, § 81, and Kudeshkina, cited above, § 86). The Government relied on the need to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary, but the opinions and statements publicly expressed by the applicant did not contain attacks on other members of the justice system (compare Di Giovanni and Poyraz, cited above), nor did they concern criticism of the judicial handling of an ongoing case (Kudeshkina, cited above, § 94).144.  The Court notes, by contrast, that the applicant expressed his opinion and criticisms on a provision affecting freedom of expression. Accordingly, it takes the view that his statements were clearly part of a debate on matters of general interest. It follows that the applicant™s freedom of expression should have enjoyed a high level of protection and that any interference with the exercise of that freedom should have been strictly scrutinised, with only a narrow margin of appreciation being afforded to the authorities of the respondent State (see, mutatis mutandis, Previti v. Italy (dec), no. 45291/06, § 253, 8 December 2009).Third series of statements145.  As regards the third series of statements, the Court observes that they dealt with certain topical issues. More specifically, they criticised: the attitude of the President of the Republic vis-à-vis international institutions; statements by the President of Religious Affairs on judicial decisions relating to compulsory religious education; constitutional reform (the applicant cited the names of judges and prosecutors who had been murdered in the performance of their duties); and the appointment of the former Secretary to the Ministry of Justice as Minister of Justice during the election period. In those statements he also took a position on the wearing of the Islamic headscarf by the wife of the President of the Republic, on the importance of the separation of powers and the principle of secularism, and on politicians™ speeches directed at the courts and the justice system in general (point 4 (a) (i-viii)).146.  The Court notes that this series of statements was found to be incompatible not only with the judicial professions but also with the aim of the association of which the applicant was chair.147.  The Court observes that some of the statements in question Œ namely his criticism of statements by the President of Religious Affairs on judicial decisions relating to compulsory religious education, his criticism of constitutional reform, his criticism of the appointment of the former Secretary to the Ministry of Justice as Minister of Justice during the election period, his reminder of the importance of the separation of powers and the  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT53principle of secularism, and his position on politicians™ speeches directed at the courts and the justice system in general Œ largely concerned issues relating to the justice system. In this connection, the Court would simply repeat the considerations it expressed above, namely that these statements clearly concerned a debate on matters of general interest and called for a high level of protection of the applicant™s freedom of expression.148.  Admittedly, some of those statements related to topical issues which were not directly relevant to questions concerning the justice system. In this connection, it should be emphasised that it is important that, although their participation in public debate on major societal issues cannot be ruled out, members of the judiciary should at least refrain from making political statements of such a nature as to compromise their independence and undermine their image of impartiality. That being so, in the instant case, the Court observes that, in its decision on the merits, the HSYK made no distinction between the applicant™s statements which related directly to the judicial system and those concerning different issues. Furthermore, it takes the view that account should have been taken of the fact that the applicant was also speaking in his capacity as chair of an association of judges and prosecutors. Although political statements by members of the judicial professions may give rise to reservations, it must be noted that, in its decision of 19 July 2011, the HSYK did not explain how the political statements in question were such as to undermine ﬁthe dignity and honour of the professionﬂ and to cause the applicant to forfeit ﬁdignity and personal esteemﬂ (point 4). In fact only a minority of the statements at issue did not directly concern the justice system and those statements did not contain any gratuitous attacks on politicians or other judicial officers. The Court cannot find sufficient grounds in the HSYK™s decision to justify the conclusion that, by his statements, the applicant undermined the dignity and honour of the judicial professions (contrast  v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (dec), no. 25255/10, §§ 35-36, 15 November 2016).(3)Whether there were procedural safeguards149.  The Court would refer back to its conclusion under Article 6 of the Convention that the disciplinary sanction in question was not reviewed by one of the ordinary courts of the respondent State™s justice system (see paragraph 105 above). It can be seen from Article 159 of the Constitution that disciplinary sanctions imposed on judges and prosecutors are not subject to judicial review except for the sanction of dismissal.150.  It must be emphasised that the role of the courts in a democratic State is to guarantee the very existence of the rule of law. When disciplinary proceedings are brought against a judge, public confidence in the functioning of the justice system is at stake. The Court is of the view that any judge and prosecutor who face disciplinary proceedings must be afforded safeguards against arbitrariness. He or she must in particular be  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT54able to have the measure in question scrutinised by an independent and impartial body competent to review all the relevant questions of fact and law, in order to determine the lawfulness of the measure and censure a possible abuse by the authorities. Before that review body the person concerned must have the benefit of adversarial proceedings in order to present his or her views and counter the arguments of the authorities (see paragraph 124 above and, for a recapitulation of the relevant principles, Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, §§ 176-86).151.  In addition, it should be observed that in the present case the HSYK gave its decision without seeing fit to address the arguments of the applicant, who was relying on the protection of Article 10 of the Convention. In that connection, even though the Government™s considerations about the duty of discretion of members of judiciary may be found relevant in the present case, the Court observes that the HSYK failed to weigh in the balance the applicant™s right to freedom of expression, in an appropriate manner and in accordance with the above-mentioned relevant criteria. In those circumstances, the Court is not persuaded that sufficient grounds have been put forward in the present case in order to justify the impugned measure. Moreover, the same shortcomings and the same lack of any judicial review prevent the Court from effectively exercising its European scrutiny as to the question whether the national authorities applied the established norms in its case-law concerning the weighing-up of the various interests at stake.(4)Conclusion152.  In the light of the considerations given above, the Court concludes that the Government™s submissions about the duty of discretion of members of the judiciary were relevant, especially as regards the first and third series of statements in question. However, particularly in view of the fact that the decision-making process followed in the present case was highly defective and did not afford the safeguards that were indispensable to the applicant™s status as a judicial officer and as the chair of an association of judges and prosecutors, it considers that the impugned restrictions on the applicant™s right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention were not accompanied by effective and adequate safeguards against abuse (see, to similar effect, Baka, cited above, § 174).153.  Having regard to the foregoing, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.IV.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION154.  The applicant alleged that the failure to destroy the recordings obtained through telephone tapping was illegal. He submitted that the recordings at issue had been kept in the file and that only copies had been  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT55destroyed. In addition to this complaint, he alleged that these recordings had been leaked to the press and that he had been transferred outside Ankara, following the imposition of a sanction, without due respect for the guarantees related to his status as a judicial officer or for his family requirements. He relied on Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:ﬁ1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.ﬂ155.  The Government submitted that the essence of the applicant™s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention concerned an alleged violation of his right to respect for his private life on account of the use, in the context of the disciplinary investigation, of recordings of his telephone conversations, which had been intercepted during the criminal investigation. They first argued that the applicant did not have victim status within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. In that connection, they made the following points: even if the Second Chamber of the HSYK had based its decision of 19 July 2011, inter alia, on the recordings of the telephone conversations, the Plenary Assembly of the HSYK had re-examined the accusations against the applicant following his appeal; in its decision that formation had held that the content of the telephone conversations was not of such a nature and gravity as to justify the imposition of a disciplinary sanction and, consequently, it had decided not to impose a sanction on the applicant in respect of any acts based on that intercept evidence. The Government argued, secondly, that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies. In their view, the applicant could have sued for compensation in respect of the damage allegedly sustained as a result of the telephone tapping in question.156.  The applicant did not comment on these points.157.  The Court begins by noting that the applicant has not complained about the monitoring of his telephone calls or about the legislation applicable in such matters. It notes that, in so far as the applicant might be understood as complaining that a disciplinary sanction had been imposed as a result of an unlawful use of recordings obtained through telephone tapping and the consequences of that measure, it can be seen from the decision of 6 June 2012, adopted by the Plenary Assembly of the HSYK, that those recordings did not give rise to the imposition of a disciplinary sanction against him (paragraph 18 above). Furthermore, with respect to the applicant™s allegation that these recordings were leaked to the press, the Court observes that the applicant did not provide any evidence to support  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT56this complaint. The same is true of the alleged consequences of the measure. However, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the case it is unnecessary to dwell on this part of the complaint on the following grounds.158.  The Court notes that the applicant™s complaint under Article 8 of the Convention, as formulated in his application form, was rather open-ended. Indeed, he further alleged that the failure to destroy the recordings obtained through telephone tapping was illegal. The Court notes that, in their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, the Government stated that ﬁthe essence of the applicant™s complaint concern[ed] an alleged violation [of his right to respect for his private life] on account of the fact that the records of his telephone conversations, [obtained during the criminal investigation], were used in the administrative investigationﬂ.159.  In the light of the criteria developed in its case-law on the notion of ﬁcomplaintﬂ (see Radomilja and Others v. Croatia ([GC], nos. 37685/10 and 22768/12, §§ 110-27, 20 March 2018), the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant™s complaint also concerns the use of the recordings of his telephone conversations, obtained during the criminal investigation, outside the purpose for which they were collected. In so doing, it takes into account not only the manner in which this complaint was presented in the application form and the facts complained of (ibid., § 120) but also the characterisation given by the Government to this complaint.160.  Therefore, in so far as the applicant might be understood to have complained about the use, in the context of the disciplinary investigation, of recordings of his telephone conversations, which had been intercepted during the criminal investigation, the Court considers that the present case is similar to that of  (cited above). In that case, with regard to the system of compensation invoked by the Government, it dismissed a similar preliminary objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies (ibid., § 60) and concluded that the tapping of the applicant™s telephone lines constituted an interference by a public authority within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (ibid., § 76). Consequently, it dismisses the Government™s objections that the applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies and lacked victim status. It notes that this part of the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention and is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.161.  With regard to the substance of this complaint, the Court would point out that, again in the above-cited  case, it found that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, taking the view that the material obtained by the interception of telephone communications in criminal proceedings had been used for the purposes of the disciplinary investigation and that such interference was not ﬁin accordance with the lawﬂ within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention (ibid., § 119). Having assessed the present case in the light of the principles set out in its  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT57above-mentioned case-law, the Court finds that the Government have failed to present any factual element or argument that would lead to any other conclusion. Indeed, it observes in the present case that while, according to a letter of 31 December 2009, the Istanbul public prosecutor in charge of the investigation sent the applicant an information note on the discontinuance of the proceedings and the destruction of material gathered during the surveillance (see paragraph 32 above), a copy undoubtedly remained in the hands of the judicial inspectors, who used this data as part of the disciplinary investigation against the applicant. As noted in the case of  (cited above, § 117), the use of these data outside the purpose for which they had been collected was not in conformity with domestic legislation.The Court therefore finds a violation of Article 8 of the Convention as regards the use, in the context of a disciplinary investigation, of recordings of the applicant™s telephone conversations.V.OTHER COMPLAINTS162.  Under Article 13 the applicant complained about a lack of judicial review of the disciplinary procedure.Lastly, relying on Article 14 of the Convention, he complained that the criminal investigation (which was discontinued) and the disciplinary proceedings had been conducted on account of his position as chair of Yarsav, an association of judges and prosecutors.A.Article 13 of the Convention163.  Under Article 13 the Court observes that the applicant complained about the lack of any judicial review of the disciplinary proceedings. It first notes that this complaint is the same as the one raised under Article 6 § 1. It reiterates, in any event, that the role of Article 6 in relation to Article 13 is lex specialis, the requirements of Article 13 being absorbed by the more stringent requirements of Article 6 (see, for example, Baka, cited above, § 181). Given the Court™s findings under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see paragraph 105 above), the present complaint under Article 13 raises no separate issue (see, for example, Oleksandr Volkov, cited above, § 189).Accordingly, the Court finds that it does not need to examine separately the admissibility or merits of the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention taken together with Article 10.B.Article 14 of the Convention164.  Under this provision the applicant complained that the criminal investigation (which was discontinued) and the disciplinary proceedings had  v. TURKEY JUDGMENT58been conducted on account of his position as chair of Yarsav, an association of judges and prosecutors.The Court has not found any evidence to suggest that the proceedings against the applicant were brought wholly or in part on one of the discriminatory grounds in Article 14. It further observes that the applicant is not able to provide any explanation in support of his allegations.It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.VI.APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION165.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:ﬁIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.ﬂ166.  The Court notes that the applicant indicated in his application form that he wished to obtain pecuniary compensation for the non-pecuniary damage he claimed to have sustained as a result of the violations of the Convention.167.  The Court would point out that, in the letter that it sent to the applicant™s representative at the stage of the proceedings when notice of the application was given to the Government, it clearly stated that the indication given by the applicant at an earlier stage of his wishes by way of just satisfaction would not compensate for any failure to make such a ﬁclaimﬂ in his observations. Consequently, in the light of the general principles, as set out in the Nagmetov v. Russia judgment ([GC], no. 35589/08, §§ 57-61, 30 March 2017), and its established practice in such matters, the Court takes the view that the indication by the applicant, at an initial non-contentious stage of the proceedings before it, of his wish to obtain compensation cannot be regarded as a ﬁclaimﬂ within the meaning of Rule 60 of the Rules of Court. In addition, it notes that it is not in dispute that no ﬁclaimﬂ for just satisfaction was made in the proceedings before the Chamber after notice of the application was given in 2019. Accordingly, there is no cause to make any award to the applicant on this basis. +++$+++ decision UNANIMOUSLY,1.Declares the complaints concerning Articles 6 § 1, 10 and 8 of the Convention admissible;2.Declares the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention inadmissible; v.

.  The case concerns allegations that the criminal proceedings against the applicant for a minor offence were unfair, insofar as the court relied on the statement of witnesses whom she had not been able to question..  The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Prahova.3.  The Government were represented by their Agent, most recently Ms O.F. Ezer, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.4.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.5.  On 13 February 2009 R.M. lodged a criminal complaint with the Prahova police, accusing the applicant of assaulting her on the street. The applicant and R.M. gave statements to the police. The police also heard evidence from three eyewitnesses. On 14 February 2009 witness A declared NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT2that he had seen the applicant hit the victim. On 6 March 2009 witnesses B (the applicant™s sister) and C denied that the applicant had hit the victim. The victim also provided the police with a medical certificate stating that she had bruises on her head which did not require medical treatment. It appears that all the statements were taken in the absence of the applicant or a lawyer representing her.6.  On 28 July 2009 the prosecutor™s office attached to the  District Court instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant under Article 180 § 1 of the Criminal Code (ﬁthe CCﬂ), a provision prohibiting hitting and other acts of violence (see paragraph 11 below).7.  By a decision of 15 December 2010 the prosecutor™s office discontinued the proceedings. It considered that the applicant had hit and injured the victim, but that the acts committed by her, fuelled by an ongoing dispute between the parties, were not serious enough to constitute a criminal offence. In accordance with Articles 181, 90 and 91 of the CC and Articles 10 (b1) and 11 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (ﬁthe CCPﬂ) (see paragraph 13 below), it imposed an administrative fine of 400 Romanian lei (RON) (approximately 90 euros (EUR) at the time).8.  On 18 March 2011, following an objection raised by the applicant, the chief prosecutor of the same prosecutor™s office upheld the decision.9.  On 8 April 2011 the applicant lodged an objection against the two decisions with the  District Court under Article 2781 of the CCP. Her lawyer argued before the court that the evidence in the case file did not support the conclusion that she had committed the acts she had been accused of.10.  In a final decision of 21 June 2011 (available to the parties on 16 August 2011) the District Court dismissed the objection, finding as follows:ﬁAs can be seen from the evidence in the [case] file, [the applicant] denied being in a dispute with [R.M.] or having injured her.It is true that during the police investigation both [the applicant] and [the victim] proposed witnesses in order to support their case. However, in addition [to the witness evidence], the victim also provided a medical certificate which, together with the statements made by witness [A] represents genuine evidence proving beyond any doubt that the events occurred exactly as described [by R.M.].Bearing in mind the minimal violation of [R.M.™s] physical integrity and the particular and personal circumstances in which the events occurred, the court considers that it was correct to discontinue the criminal prosecution and impose an administrative fine. It is obvious that such acts cannot remain unpunished, even when they only cause minimal harm to the social values protected.ﬂRELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK11.  The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code (ﬁthe CCﬂ) in force at the time of the events in the present case were worded as follows:NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT3Article 1 Œ Aim of the criminal lawﬁCriminal law protects, against crimes, Romania, the sovereignty, independence, unity and indivisibility of the State, the person, its rights and freedoms, property and the rule of law.ﬂArticle 17 Œ Essential characteristics of a criminal offenceﬁA criminal offence is an act which presents a danger to society, is committed with culpable intent () and is provided for by criminal law.A criminal offence is the sole basis of criminal liability.ﬂArticle 18 Œ Social danger of an actﬁAn act presenting a danger to society for the purposes of criminal law shall be understood to mean any action or inaction which undermines one of the values mentioned in Article 1 and for which the imposition of a sentence is required.ﬂArticle 181 Œ Acts not having the social danger of a criminal offenceﬁ1.  An act punishable by criminal law shall not constitute a criminal offence if, in view of its minimal interference with one of the values safeguarded by criminal law and the manifestly insignificant nature of its specific content, it does not present the degree of danger to society associated with a criminal offence.2.  In determining the degree of danger to society, account must be taken of the manner and means by which the act was committed, the aim pursued, the circumstances in which the act was committed, the result which was or could have been produced, and the character and conduct of the perpetrator, if known.3.  In the event of such an act, the public prosecutor or the court shall impose one of the administrative sanctions provided for in Article 91.ﬂArticle 90 Œ Conditions for replacement [of criminal liability]ﬁ(1)  The court may replace criminal liability with ... an administrative sanction, if the following conditions are met:(a)  the sentence prescribed by law for the offence is imprisonment for a maximum of one year or a fine or for the offences provided for in Articles 208, 213, Article 215 § 1, Article 2151 § 1, Article 217 § 1, Article 219 § 1, if the value of the damage does not exceed 10 Romanian lei or for the offence provided for in Article 249, if the value of the damage does not exceed 50 Romanian lei;(b)  because of its specific content and the circumstances in which it was committed, the act presents a low degree of social danger and did not produce serious consequences;(c)  the damage caused by the offence has been fully repaired pending the delivery of the decision;(d)  the perpetrator regrets the act;(e)  there is sufficient information indicating that the perpetrator can be redeemed without punishment.(2)  Criminal liability cannot be replaced if the perpetrator has previously been convicted or has twice been subject to administrative sanctions...ﬂNEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT4Article 91 Œ Administrative sanctionsﬁWhere a court orders the replacement of criminal liability, it shall impose one of the following administrative sanctions:...(c)  a fine of between 10 and 1,000 lei.ﬂTitle II: Crimes against the personChapter 1: Crimes against life, physical integrity and healthSection II: Hitting and damage to physical integrity or healthArticle 180 Œ Hitting or other violenceﬁ(1)  Hitting or any acts of violence causing physical harm shall be punishable by imprisonment of one to three months or by a fine.ﬂ12.  On 1 February 2014 a new Criminal Code (ﬁthe NCCﬂ) entered into force in the Respondent State. The provisions which would be applicable to a situation similar to that raised in the present case read as follows:Article 80 Œ Conditions for waiving sentencingﬁ(1)  The court may decide to waive the imposition of a sentence if the following conditions are met:(a)  the criminal offence committed is of reduced severity, considering the nature and extent of the consequences produced, the means used, the manner and circumstances in which it was committed, the motive and the aim pursued;(b)  with regard to the offender, their prior conduct, the efforts made by [him or her] to remove or reduce the consequences of the criminal offence, as well as [his or her] possibility of correction, the court considers that the imposition of a sentence would be inappropriate because of the consequences it would have for the offender.(2)  It is not possible to waive the imposition of a sentence if:(a)  the offender has previously been convicted, except in the cases stipulated in Article 42 (a) and (b) [deeds which are no longer prohibited by criminal law, and offences which have been amnestied] or where rehabilitation has taken place or the time-limits for rehabilitation have been met;(b)  the offender has benefitted from a waiver of sentence in the two years preceding the date of commission of the offence for which he [or she] is currently being tried;(c)  the offender has evaded the criminal investigation or trial, or attempted to prevent the discovery of the truth or the identification and prosecution of the perpetrator or other participants;(d)  the punishment set by law for the criminal offence committed is imprisonment of more than five years.(3)  In the event of concurrent offences, a waiver of imposition of a sentence may be ordered if, for each concurrent offence, the conditions set out in paragraphs (1) and (2) above are met.ﬂ13.  The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (ﬁthe CCPﬂ), as in force at the material time, provided as follows:NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT5Article 10 Œ Cases when criminal prosecutions are not started or are droppedﬁ1.  Criminal proceedings cannot be instituted or continued if:...(b1)  the act did not present the degree of social danger required to be classified as a criminal offence;ﬂArticle 11 Œ Termination of criminal investigation, prosecution, acquittal and termination of criminal trialﬁWhere any of the cases set out in Article 10 is found to exist:1.  During the criminal proceedings, the public prosecutor, on an application by the prosecuting authority or proprio motu, shall order: ...(b)  the discontinuation of the proceedings (scoaterea de sub ) in favour of the suspect or accused, in the cases set out in Article 10 (a) to (e)....ﬂArticle 172 Œ Rights of the defenceﬁ(1)  During the criminal investigation, the defence counsel of the accused or defendant has the right to participate in any investigative activities and make requests and submit documents. An investigative activity may take place even in counsel™s absence, if there is evidence that counsel was notified of the date and time of the activity. Notification shall be made by telephone, fax, Internet or other such means, and a report shall be concluded in this regard....(3)  If the [defence] counsel is present during an investigative activity, his [or her] presence shall be noted, and the [relevant document] shall also be signed by counsel....(6)  Counsel has the right to complain, in accordance with Article 275, if his [or her] requests are not accepted ...ﬂArticle 275 Œ Right to lodge a complaintﬁAnyone may lodge a complaint in respect of measures and decisions taken during a criminal investigation, if they have harmed his or her legitimate interests ...ﬂArticle 278 Œ Complaint against the prosecutor™s activitiesﬁComplaints against measures or decisions taken by a prosecutor or implemented at the latter™s request shall be examined by ... the chief prosecutor of the relevant department ....ﬂArticle 2781 Œ Complaint before the judge against the prosecutor™s decisions or order not to prosecuteﬁ(1)  Following the dismissal by the prosecutor of a complaint lodged under Articles 275 to 278 in respect of a decision to discontinue a criminal investigation ... or a decision not to prosecute ( ) ..., the injured party, or any other person whose legitimate interests have been harmed, may complain within twenty NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT6days of notification of the decision, to the judge of the court that would normally have jurisdiction to hear the case at first instance....(7)  The judge ruling on the complaint shall verify the prosecutor™s decision or order, on the basis of the material and evidence in the file and any new documents submitted.(8)  The judge shall take one of the following decisions:(a)  reject the complaint, by a decision, as out of time, inadmissible or unfounded, and uphold the contested decision or order;(b)  allow the complaint, by a decision, set aside the prosecutor™s decision or order and refer the case to the prosecutor™s office, in order to start or reopen the criminal investigation, as appropriate. The judge shall give reasons for why he [or she] has referred the case to the prosecutor, and shall indicate the facts and circumstances to be verified and the evidence to be collected;(c)  allow the complaint, by an interlocutory judgment, set aside the prosecutor™s decision or order and, if the evidence in the case file is sufficient, examine the case as a court of first instance, the provisions concerning the procedure at first instance and appeal proceedings being applicable....(10)  A decision rendered under paragraph 8 shall be final.ﬂ14.  On 1 February 2014 a new Code of Criminal Procedure (ﬁthe NCCPﬂ) entered into force in the Respondent State. The procedure provided for in Article 2781 of the CCP was replaced with a new procedure, described in Article 340 of the NCCP, which reads as follows:Article 340 Œ Complaint against the decision not to prosecute or not to indictﬁ(1)  Anyone whose complaint against the decision not to prosecute (clasare), taken in a prosecutor™s order or an indictment, has been rejected in accordance with Article 339 [complaints against prosecutor™s activities or decisions] may complain, within [twenty] days of the date the decision was notified, to the preliminary chamber judge from the court that would, by law, hear the case at first instance.ﬂ15.  In two decisions rendered in 2004 and 2006, the Romanian Constitutional Court ruled that the limitation of the evidence that could be examined in the procedure provided for by Article 2781 of the CCP was justified by the specific nature of that procedure. In particular, the procedure (used by the applicant in the present case) did not concern the merits of the criminal case, and was only meant to verify the lawfulness of decisions taken by the prosecutor. The Constitutional Court considered that, under the procedure, this verification was done by examining the documents in the criminal file which had formed the basis of the prosecutor™s decision.16.  Enforcement of an administrative fine imposed under Article 181 of the CC was carried out in accordance with the procedure provided for by Government Ordinance No. 2/2001, which at the material time read as follows:NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT7Article 39ﬁEnforcement of the sanction of a fine shall be done as follows:(a)  by the authority to which the administrative officer belongs, whenever the appeal against the administrative decision concerning the contravention is not exercised within the time-limits prescribed by law;(b)  by the court, in any other cases.ﬂArticle 391ﬁ(1)  If the offender has not paid the fine within [thirty] days of the date [the decision imposing] the fine became final, and there is no possibility of enforcement, he [or she] shall notify the court within whose territorial jurisdiction the offence was committed, in order to obtain replacement of the fine with the sanction of community service, taking into account, where appropriate, the part of the fine that has been paid.(2)  If the offender, summoned by the court, has not paid the fine within the time-limit prescribed in paragraph (1), the court shall replace the fine with community service for a maximum duration of [fifty] hours, and for minors over the age of 16, [for a maximum duration of twenty-five] hours.(3)  A decision imposing community service may be appealed against.(4)  The civil enforcement service attached to the district court within whose territorial jurisdiction the contravention took place shall be responsible for the execution of such decisions, in collaboration with special departments of the local public authorities.ﬂ17.  At the time of the events in the present case, it was not possible for the courts to replace an unpaid administrative fine with days in prison. This option, which had been available in the past, was removed from the law in 2003 (for further details, see Anghel v. Romania, no. 28183/03, §§ 39 and 52, 4 October 2007, and Nicoleta Gheorghe v. Romania, no. 23470/05, §§ 16 and 31, 3 April 2012).18.  At the material time, the Criminal Records Act (Law no. 290/2004) contained the following provisions:Article 9ﬁA person™s criminal record shall contain the following information:(a)  criminal sanctions ... imposed by a final court decision;(b)  ... administrative fines imposed under the provisions of the Criminal Code, ...ﬂArticle 17ﬁA criminal record certificate shall contain the criminal sanctions imposed by final court decisions.ﬂArticle 21ﬁ(2)  When a copy of the criminal record is sent to a judicial authority, information about administrative sanctions imposed under the provisions of the Criminal Code shall also be appended.ﬂNEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT8Article 27ﬁ(1)  Anyone may obtain their own criminal record certificate.ﬂTHE LAWI.ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION19.  The applicant complained that the criminal proceedings against her had been unfair, contrary to the requirements of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, which read as follows:ﬁ1.  In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...3.  Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:...(d)  to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; ...ﬂA.Admissibility1.The Court™s jurisdiction ratione materiae(a)The parties™ submissions20.  The Government argued that the domestic proceedings giving rise to the final decision of 21 June 2011 had not been criminal proceedings for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. In their view, the complaint was thus incompatible ratione materiae with the requirements of the Convention.21.  The applicant contested that argument.(b)The Court™s assessment(i)General principles22.  The concept of a ﬁcriminal chargeﬂ in Article 6 § 1 is an autonomous one (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá v. Portugal [GC], nos. 55391/13 and 2 others, § 122, 6 November 2018). The Court™s established case-law sets out three criteria, commonly known as the ﬁEngel criteriaﬂ, to be considered in determining whether or not there was a ﬁcriminal chargeﬂ (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, § 82, Series A no. 22). The first criterion is the legal classification of the offence under national law, the second is the very nature of the offence, and the third is the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring. The second and third criteria are alternative, and not necessarily cumulative. This, however, does not exclude a cumulative approach where separate NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT9analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge (see, among other authorities, Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30 31, ECHR 2006 XIV, and Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, § 82, ECHR 2003 X). The fact that an offence is not punishable by imprisonment is not by itself decisive for the purposes of the applicability of the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention since, as the Court has stressed on numerous occasions, the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake cannot deprive an offence of its inherently criminal character (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, § 122).(ii)Application of those principles to the facts of the present case23.  The Court will examine whether, in accordance with the aforementioned Engel criteria, the imposition of an administrative fine on the applicant for the offence of which she was accused is covered by the concept of ﬁcriminal procedureﬂ.(1)Legal characterisation of the offence under national law24.  The Court notes at the outset that the applicant was charged with hitting and other acts of violence, an offence prohibited by Article 180 § 1 of the CC (see paragraphs 6 and 11 below). It is thus undisputed that the offence in question was classified as criminal in domestic law.25.  However, the Court further notes the application in the present case of Article 181 of the CC, providing that an act falling under criminal law did not constitute a criminal offence if it did not attain the requisite level of seriousness, on account of minimal interference with one of the values safeguarded by criminal law, and its specific content (see paragraph 11 above). In such circumstances, the prosecutor could decide to discontinue the prosecution and, instead of imposing the criminal penalty provided for in the definition of the offence of which the person had been accused, impose another penalty that was likewise provided for in the CC but was designated therein as ﬁadministrativeﬂ (see Mihalache v. Romania [GC], no. 54012/10, § 58, 8 July 2019).26.  In the instant case, on 15 December 2010, the prosecutor™s office discontinued the proceedings against the applicant, noting that although her acts fell under criminal law, they did not amount to a criminal offence, and imposed an administrative fine instead (see paragraph 7 above). Be that as it may, the characterisation under domestic law is merely a starting point, and the indications so afforded have only a formal and relative value (see, among many other authorities, Engel and Others, cited above, § 82). The Court will therefore undertake a more detailed analysis of the actual nature of the domestic provision forming the legal basis of the penalty imposed on NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT10the applicant and its severity (see, mutatis mutandis, Mihalache, cited above, § 58).(2)Actual nature of the applicable legal provisions27.  By its very nature, the offence under examination aims at protecting life and physical integrity, values which unquestionably fall within the scope of criminal law (see paragraph 11 above). The provisions of Article 180 of the CC were applicable, in accordance with Articles 1 and 17 of the CC, to anyone who committed, with culpable intent, an act prohibited by criminal law. It is thus important to note that although the acts of which the applicant was accused were not deemed to constitute a criminal offence by the prosecutor (see paragraph 7 above), they nevertheless fell within the scope of a provision of criminal law.28.  The fact that the criminal acts of which the applicant was accused were regarded as manifestly insignificant on account of their minimal interference with one of the values safeguarded by criminal law and their specific content, does not in itself preclude their classification as ﬁcriminalﬂ within the autonomous Convention meaning of the term, as there is nothing in the Convention to suggest that the criminal nature of an offence, within the meaning of the ﬁEngel criteriaﬂ, necessarily requires a certain degree of seriousness (see Ezeh and Connors, cited above, § 104, and Mihalache, cited above, § 60).29.  For these reasons, the Court accepts that the legal provision on the basis of which the prosecutor™s office prosecuted and punished the applicant by means of the prosecutor™s decision of 15 December 2010 (see paragraph 7 above), subsequently upheld by the final court decision of 21 June 2011 (see paragraph 10 above), was criminal in nature.(3)Degree of severity of the penalty30.  Lastly, the Court reiterates that the degree of severity of the penalty is determined by reference to the maximum penalty for which the relevant law provides. The actual penalty imposed is relevant to the determination but it cannot diminish the importance of what was initially at stake (see Mihalache, cited above, § 61, with further references).31.  In the present case, the penalty laid down in law for commission of the offence in question was up to three years™ imprisonment (see paragraph 11 above). In addition, even though the prosecutor™s office did not consider that the acts in question constituted an offence for the purposes of criminal law, it was still required by law to impose a penalty where the legal basis for discontinuing the proceedings was Article 181 of the CC. In the present case, the applicant was fined RON 400 (that is, approximately EUR 90 at the time) for the acts of which she was accused, an amount which is less than half of the maximum allowed by Article 91 of the CC NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT11(see paragraph 11 above). Be that as it may, the relative lack of seriousness of the penalty at stake will not deprive the offence of its inherently criminal nature (see paragraph 22 above).32.  The Court also notes that although the CC designates this penalty as ﬁadministrativeﬂ, the purpose of the fine was not to repair the damage caused by the applicant, but to punish her and deter her from committing further criminal acts (see Mihalache, cited above, § 62, with further references). The fine imposed on the applicant thus had a punitive and deterrent purpose and was therefore akin to a criminal penalty, despite its domestic classification as an ﬁadministrativeﬂ fine. The fact that the applicant could not risk prison time even if she failed to pay the penalty (see paragraph 17 above) does not alter this conclusion.33.  In the same vein, even though criminal record certificates delivered to persons concerned do not contain information on administrative fines, such as the one imposed on the applicant in the present case, this information is nevertheless available to the judicial authorities on the same basis as information concerning any other criminal sanction imposed on that person (see paragraph 18 above).(4)Conclusion concerning the nature of the proceedings leading to the final decision of 21 June 201134.  Having regard to the foregoing, the Court concludes that the nature of the offence for which the applicant was prosecuted and the penalty imposed on her, render the proceedings under examination criminal in nature, for the purpose of Article 6 of the Convention. The criminal limb of Article 6 thus applies to the facts of the present case. Consequently, the Court dismisses the Government™s objection of incompatibility ratione materiae.2.Other grounds for inadmissibility35.  The Court further notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention. It must therefore be declared admissible.B.Merits1.The parties™ submissions(a)The applicant36.  The applicant argued that the District Court had not had full jurisdiction to consider her complaints concerning the finding of guilt and had not afforded her the procedural safeguards of Article 6 of the Convention. She contended that the District Court had only examined the lawfulness of the two decisions and had done no more than uphold the NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT12findings concerning her guilt. The prosecutor™s office, however, had failed to ensure the principle of adversarial proceedings, despite the fact that the witnesses had given contradictory statements.(b)The Government37.  The Government argued that the applicant had benefitted from all procedural safeguards expected in this type of case. For instance, she had proposed witnesses during the police investigation. However, she had failed to request to be present during the witness interviews. Moreover, she had not repeated her requests for evidence before the District Court.38.  They also pointed out that the purpose of the proceedings before the court had not been to assess a person™s guilt, but rather to examine the lawfulness of the decisions of the prosecutor™s office, based primarily on the evidence already in the case file.2.The Court™s assessment(a)Preliminary remarks39.  Having established that the case falls within the scope of the criminal limb of Article 6, the Court must ascertain whether, bearing in mind the particular characteristics of the domestic proceedings at stake, the full guarantees of Article 6 apply to the facts of the present case.40.  In this connection, it notes that in Blokhin v. Russia ([GC], no. 47152/06, §§ 179-182, 23 March 2016), having found that the proceedings against the applicant for the commission of a delinquent act which, due to the applicant™s age, was not classified as criminal in domestic law, concerned the determination of a criminal charge, the Court examined them in the light of all the safeguards enshrined in Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (see Blokhin, cited above, §§ 211-16).41.  In the same vein, in Anghel v. Romania (no. 28183/03, §§ 55-69, 4 October 2007), the Court applied the full set of safeguards provided by Article 6 of the Convention to domestic proceedings which, although non-criminal under domestic law, were considered by the Court to fall within the scope of the protection guaranteed by the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention.42.  For these reasons, and bearing in mind that the Convention guarantees rights which are practical and effective (see, among many other authorities, Artico v. Italy, 13 May 1980, § 33, Series A no. 37; Alekseyev v. Russia, nos. 4916/07 and 2 others, § 81, 21 October 2010; and Maskhadova and Others v. Russia, no. 18071/05, § 222, 6 June 2013), the Court considers that all the guarantees enshrined in the criminal limb of Article 6 of the Convention, as interpreted in the relevant case-law (see paragraphs 43-46 below), apply to the facts of the present case.NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT13(b)General principles43.  The Court reiterates that the guarantees in paragraph 3 (d) of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair hearing set forth in paragraph 1 of that Article, which must be taken into account in any assessment of the fairness of proceedings. In addition, the Court™s primary concern under Article 6 § 1 is to evaluate the overall fairness of the criminal proceedings (see Schatschaschwili v. Germany [GC], no. 9154/10, §§ 100-01, 15 December 2015, and Taxquet v. Belgium [GC], no. 926/05, § 84, 16 November 2010, with further references). In making this assessment, the Court will look at the proceedings as a whole, having regard to the rights of the defence but also to the interests of the public and the victim(s) that crime is properly prosecuted (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 101, and Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 175, ECHR 2010) and, where necessary, to the rights of witnesses (see, amongst many authorities, Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06, § 118, ECHR 2011). It is also notable in this context that the admissibility of evidence is a matter for regulation by national law and the national courts and that the Court™s only concern is to examine whether the proceedings have been conducted fairly (see Seton v. the United Kingdom, no. 55287/10, § 57, 31 March 2016, with further references).44.  The Court has formulated the general principles to be applied in cases where a prosecution witness did not attend a trial but statements previously made by him or her were admitted in evidence; those general principles are set out in the cases of AlKhawaja and Tahery (cited above, §§ 118-47). A summary of those principles can also be found in Seton (cited above, § 58) and Blokhin (cited above, §§ 200-02). In this respect, having regard to the Court™s case-law, firstly, there must be a good reason for the non-attendance of a witness at the trial and, secondly, when a conviction is based solely or to a decisive degree on depositions that have been made by a person whom the accused has had no opportunity to examine or to have examined, whether during the investigation or at the trial, the rights of the defence may be restricted to an extent that is incompatible with the guarantees provided by Article 6 (see Blokhin, cited above, § 201, with further references).45.  Those principles have been further clarified in Schatschaschwili (cited above, §§ 111-31), in which the Grand Chamber confirmed that the absence of good reason for the non-attendance of a witness could not, of itself, be conclusive of the lack of fairness of a trial, although it remained a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness, and one which might tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d). Furthermore, given that its concern is to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, the Court must not only review the existence of sufficient counterbalancing factors in cases NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT14where the evidence of the absent witness was the sole or decisive basis for the applicant™s conviction, but also in cases where it finds it unclear whether the evidence in question was sole or decisive but is nevertheless satisfied that it carried significant weight and its admission may have handicapped the defence. The extent of the counterbalancing factors necessary in order for a trial to be considered fair will depend on the weight of the evidence of the absent witness. The more important that evidence, the more weight the counterbalancing factors will have to carry in order for the proceedings as a whole to be considered fair (ibid., § 116, see also Seton, cited above, § 59).46.  In this context, where a conviction is based solely or decisively on the evidence of absent witnesses, the Court must subject the proceedings to the most searching scrutiny (see Blokhin, cited above, § 202).(c)Application of those principles to the facts of the present case47.  Turning to the facts of the case under examination, the Court notes that the applicant was placed under investigation by the prosecutor™s office (see paragraph 6 above), but that the proceedings were eventually discontinued on the grounds that the acts committed were not serious enough to constitute a criminal offence (see paragraph 7 above). The applicant, who received a fine from the prosecutor™s office, contested the outcome before a criminal court, availing herself of the procedure under Article 2781 of the CCP.48.  The Court reiterates that under the procedure in question the domestic courts were called upon to examine the lawfulness of the decisions of the prosecutor™s office and had no power to hear witness evidence or directly assess the merits of the case. However, the Court cannot but note that in finding that the events had occurred as described by the victim and that the applicant had committed acts prohibited by criminal law which ﬁ[could] not remain unpunishedﬂ (see paragraph 10 above), the domestic court did, in fact, make an assessment of the applicant™s guilt. In doing so, it referred to the statement made by a witness, A, who had not appeared before it.49.  The Court notes that the witness was only heard during the investigation (see paragraph 5 above). In this context, the Court must assess whether there was a good reason for the non-attendance of that witness before the court, such as death or fear, absence on health grounds or the witness™s unreachability (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 119, with further references). The Court notes that the applicable law did not allow the courts to hear witness testimony in the procedure under Article 2781 of the CCP, as they were bound to examine the complaint based on the evidence already in the file, the sole exception being the possibility to examine additional documents, if need be (see Article 2781 § 7 of the CCP, cited in paragraph 13 above). This, however, is not a good reason justifying the non-attendance of the relevant witness, for the purposes of Article 6 of the NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT15Convention. It is also relevant to note that there is no indication, nor was it claimed by the Government, that A had not been available or that it would otherwise have been difficult to summon him to appear before the court (see Blokhin, cited above, § 213).50.  As for the significance of the evidence of the absent witness, the Court notes that the domestic court reached its decision in the case by relying on witness A™s statement, which corroborated the medical evidence. It can be inferred from this that A™s statement was decisive for the court™s conclusion (see, mutatis mutandis, Schatschaschwili, § 141, and Blokhin, § 212, both cited above).51.  It remains to be determined whether there were sufficient counterbalancing factors to compensate for the handicaps under which the defence laboured as a result of the admission of the decisive evidence of the absent witness (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 145). In other words, the Court must ensure that the trial, judged as a whole, was fair, bearing in mind that the lack of a good reason for a prosecution witness™s absence is a very important factor to be weighed in the balance when assessing the overall fairness of a trial which may tip the balance in favour of finding a breach of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) (see the case-law quoted in paragraph 45 above). One important safeguard would be to have given the applicant or defence counsel an opportunity to question the witnesses during the investigation stage (see Schatschaschwili, cited above, § 131). However, there is no evidence in the file that the defence was informed of the date the witnesses were interviewed, and it appears that the applicant was neither present nor represented during the police questioning (see paragraph 5 above) and the Government did not put forward any justification as to why that was the case. There is nothing in the case file to indicate that he was in any way informed of the date when the witnesses would be interviewed by the investigators or invited to participate.52.  The Court notes that in her complaint lodged with the domestic court the applicant contested the evidence (see paragraph 9 above). The court nevertheless based its decision on that evidence (see paragraph 10 above). As the domestic court did not have the power to hear witnesses, the Court does not see any reason why she, as suggested by the Government, should have expressly requested that the court hear the witnesses (see paragraph 9 above).53.  Moreover, on this point, the Court cannot but note that even in the absence of the power to hear witnesses, the court had at its disposal other means to resolve the case which could, at least in theory, have ensured better protection of the rights of the defence. In particular, it notes that under Article 2781 of the CCP the domestic courts had the power to set aside a decision taken by the prosecutor™s office and either refer the case back to the prosecutor™s office or examine it further in proper criminal proceedings, as a first-instance court (see paragraph 13 above). However, in NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT16the present case, the domestic court did not avail itself of any of these options, but instead upheld the prosecutor™s decision without hearing evidence, thus frustrating the applicant™s opportunity to cross-examine the witness whose testimony was of decisive importance. In doing so, the court deprived the applicant of the possibility to have her case examined in compliance with the requirements of the Convention.54.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention.II.OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION55.  Lastly, the applicant complained that she had lacked an effective remedy by which to complain about the decision of 21 June 2011, in violation of Article 13 of the Convention.56.  However, in the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols.57.  Accordingly, this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.III.APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION58.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:ﬁIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.ﬂA.Damage59.  The applicant claimed 400 Romanian lei (RON) in respect of pecuniary damage, representing the fine imposed on her by the prosecutor™s office. She also sought 1,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage for loss of her image, honour and reputation in the community.60.  The Government contended that there was no causal link between the complaint brought by the applicant before the Court and the pecuniary damage sought. Furthermore, they pointed out that she could seek the reopening of the proceedings under Article 465 § 1 of the CCP. Lastly, they contended that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction for the alleged non-pecuniary damage.61.  The Court notes that Article 465 § 1 of the CCP allows for the reopening of the domestic proceedings in order to remedy the breaches found by it. Given the nature of the applicant™s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, the Court considers that in the present case the most NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT17appropriate form of redress would be, at the applicant™s request, the reopening of the proceedings complained of in due course.62.  On the other hand, the Court considers that she must have suffered a certain amount of distress which cannot be compensated solely by the reopening of the proceedings or the finding of a violation. Having regard to the nature of the violation found, and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards her EUR 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.B.Costs and expenses63.  The applicant also claimed RON 514 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court.64.  The Government argued that the costs had not been necessarily incurred.65.  Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its case-law, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 100 covering costs under all heads, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant.C.Default interest66.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points. +++$+++ decision.Declares, unanimously, the complaint concerning Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;2.Holds, unanimously, that there has been a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention;3.Holds,(a)by five votes to two, that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;NEGULESCU v.

ROMANIA JUDGMENT Œ SEPARATE OPINION19JOINT PARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES PASTOR VILANOVA AND SCHUKKING1.  Our dissenting opinion concerns, exclusively, the payment of just satisfaction to the applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage under Article 41 of the Convention. We have drafted this joint opinion to express our disagreement with the majority position in the Chamber on this point.2.  We are of the view that the judgment in the present case: (a) does not justify its departure from the Court™s case-law in such matters, and (b) in doing so it overlooks the need for reasoning under Article 45 § 1 of the Convention.3.  Firstly, it is to be noted that the Court has found on many occasions that it does not follow from its finding of a violation of Article 6 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention that an applicant was wrongly convicted. Indeed, it is impossible to speculate as to what might have occurred had there been no breach of the minimum rights listed in Article 6 § 3. In such circumstances the Court often takes the view that a finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction (see Sejdovic v. Italy [GC], no. 56581/00, § 134, 2006-II; Ibrahim and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 50541/08 and 3 others, § 315, ECHR 2016; and Beuze v. Belgium [GC], no. 71409/10, § 199, 9 November 2018). It is noteworthy that no less than three Grand Chamber judgments, two of which are recent, have taken such an approach. However, the Chamber now appears to be turning its back on this well-established doctrine.4.  Secondly, the Court has also taken the view that there is no need to make an award for non-pecuniary damage when the applicant is able to obtain the reopening of the domestic proceedings, after having previously been convicted. In the present case the possibility of a retrial exists under domestic law. In this respect the Court has reiterated many times that when an individual has been convicted following proceedings that have entailed breaches of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, as a rule, a retrial or the reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle the most appropriate form of redressing that violation (see, among other authorities, Sejdovic v. Italy, cited above, § 126; Öcalan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, § 210 in fine, ECHR 2005-IV; Cabral v. the Netherlands, no. 37617/10, §§ 42-43, 28 August 2018; and Chernika v. Ukraine, no. 53791/11, §§ 82-83, 12 March 2020). Once again, this well-established case-law seems to have been ignored.5.  Lastly, Article 45 § 1 of the Convention requires that reasons must be given for the Court™s judgments and decisions. This provision seems clear NEGULESCU v. ROMANIA JUDGMENT Œ SEPARATE OPINION20and no exception is permitted. As it is not otherwise stipulated, it can be inferred that the obligation to give reasons concerns the entire text of the judgment or decision and not merely certain passages of the judicial ruling. Consequently, even if the majority wished to base their findings on a different strand of case-law, or to depart from the authorities relied upon by the minority, they were under an obligation, we respectfully submit, in terms of the duty of the European adjudicator, to explain the reasons for their position. Such reasoning would have enhanced the principle of legal certainty in the present case.
